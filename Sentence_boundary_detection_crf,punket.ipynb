      "Entitlement to total rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability ( TDIU ) .REPRESENTATIONAppellant represented by : Harold H. Hoffman III , AttorneyWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEALAppellantATTORNEY FOR THE BOARDK .\n",
      "Hughes , CounselINTRODUCTIONThe Veteran had active military service from May 1973 to October 1976.These matters come before the Board of Veterans ' Appeals ( Board ) from a February 2012 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) , Regional Office ( RO ) in Portland , Oregon .\n",
      "In December 2013 , the Veteran testified at a videoconference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge .\n",
      "A transcript of that hearing is of record.In March 2014 , the Board issued a decision denying service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder , to include PTSD and major depression , and entitlement to a TDIU rating .\n",
      "The Veteran appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ( Court ) .\n",
      "In September 2014 , the Court granted the Joint Motion for Partial Remand ( Joint Motion ) ; vacated that portion of the March 2014 Board decision which denied service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder , to include PTSD and major depression , and entitlement to a TDIU rating ; and remanded the appeal to the Board for additional action consistent with the Joint Motion.The appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction ( AOJ ) .\n",
      "VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.REMANDThe Veteran contends that he has PTSD and/or depression due to his service aboard a submarine , sleep-deprivation in service , \\ '' hazing\\ '' , and a submarine drill.The Veteran 's STRs were negative for any findings of , or treatment for , an acquired psychiatric disability or symptoms of such .\n",
      "The STRs contain complaints of a lump in his breast ( April 1974 , May 1974 ) , a headache ( June 1974 ) , back pain ( June 1974 ) , an ingrown toe nail ( four visits in July 1976 ) , congestion , sore throat ( August 1976 ) low back pain ( four visits in September 1976 ) , and low back pain ( October 1976 ) .\n",
      "The records are negative for any complaints of fatigue , or lack of sleep.The Veteran was assigned to Great Lakes , Illinois from July 1973 to October 1973 .\n",
      "He was assigned to the USS Albert David at some point in 1974 .\n",
      "He was assigned to the Naval Nuclear Power School at Mare Island , California from April 1974 to September 1974 .\n",
      "He was assigned to the NUCPWR ( Nuclear Power ) Plant Operator School at Idaho Falls , Idaho from October 1974 to April 1975 .\n",
      "He served about the USS Proteus from July 1975 .\n",
      "He served about the USS Theodore Roosevelt from approximately September 1975 to October 1976 .\n",
      "In October 1976 , it was recommended that the Veteran not be reenlisted and that he be discharged for unsuitability ( i.e .\n",
      "apathy , defective attitude , and inability to expend effort effectively ) .\n",
      "The Veteran 's enlisted performance record reflects that he had a professional performance rating of 3.6 in June 1974 , and 3.4 in September 1974 , April 1975 , and July 1975 , with a final trait average of 3.45 .\n",
      "He had a military behavior rating of 3.8 in June 1974 , 3.6 in September 1974 , 3.2 in April 1975 , and 3.4 in July 1975 , with a final trait average of 3.5 .\n",
      "He had a military appearance rating of 3.8 in June 1974 , 3.6 in September 1974 , and 3.4 in April 1975 and July 1975 , with a final trait average of 3.55 .\n",
      "For adaptability , he had a 3.8 in June 1974 , and 3.4 in September 1974 , April 75 , and July 1975 , with a final trait average of 3.5 .\n",
      "An evaluation report for the period March 1974 to September 1974 reflects that the Veteran had low and declining performance , inconsistent effort , lackadaisical attitude on occasion , marginal motivation , and satisfactory military behavior .\n",
      "The Board notes that this was prior to his service on a submarine and was while he was attending the Naval Nuclear Power School at Mare Island , California.An evaluation report for a period ending in April 1975 reflects that the Veteran had completed prototype training and compared to other trainees of the same rate and experience , his rate of qualification progress was fair , his watch standing performance was fair , and his qualifications were good.A service record reflects that on July 21 , 1976 and July 22 , 1976 , the Veteran failed to go at the time prescribed to his appointed place of duty .\n",
      "Again , this was prior to his time aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt.Another service record reflects that on August 24 , 1976 , August 26 , 1976 , August 27 , 1976 , August 30 , 1976 , and September 3 , 1976 , the Veteran failed to go to the appointed places of duty .\n",
      "An August 1976 performance evaluation report reflects the following : Since reporting aboard , [ the Veteran ] has experienced problems adapting to the demanding job of operating a nuclear power plant .\n",
      "He has been delinquent in both departmental and ship 's qualification since reporting aboard .\n",
      "[ The Veteran ] has shown very little effort in completing qualification even though he has been counselled by his supervisors numerous times .\n",
      "When [ the Veteran ] was assigned the duty of divisional Repair Parts Petty Officer , constant supervision was necessary to ensure that assigned tasks were carried out .\n",
      "[ The Veteran ] has demonstrated little initiative in directing others and his negative attitude has also been reflected toward the naval service .\n",
      "[ The Veteran ] is an individual who desires isolation from others .\n",
      "He has been observed and counseled many times about unproductive use of his time when he should have been working on his qualifications or supply duties .\n",
      "[ The Veteran ] does not take pride in his personal appearance when in uniform and has to be constantly prodded to ensure he meets the minimum standard of dress and grooming .\n",
      "[ the Veteran ] has a good knowledge of both written and oral English and he supports the goals of Equal Opportunity .\n",
      "He is not recommended for advancement or for reenlistment .\n",
      "It further reflects , as follows : [ The Veteran ] was prematurely relieved of his duties as Repair Parts Petty Officer due to his lack of responsibility .\n",
      "[ The Veteran ] was also placed on a remedial study program to allow him to catchup on his qualification and become an effective member of the division .\n",
      "[ The Veteran ] has made unsatisfactory progress in completing this study program .\n",
      "[ The Veteran ] has consistently proven his unreliability by arriving late for duty numerous times .\n",
      "Although he has received Commanding Officers ' Non-Judicial Punishment for these infractions , and has been counselled , he continues to reject authority and go his own way.A September 1976 Department of the Navy memorandum reflects that the Veteran was recommended for disqualification from submarine duty .\n",
      "It notes that the Veteran was absent for an inspection due to a lack of concern for his duties .\n",
      "A few days later , he was late for quarters several times and missed a muster .\n",
      "The report reflects that the Veteran had been given non-judicial punishment , but did not respond positively .\n",
      "The memorandum reflects that the Veteran had reported to the command in September 1975 from Nuclear Power training in Idaho Falls , after a three month assignment .\n",
      "His performance at the School was noted to have been \\ '' inconsistent , lackadaisical , and at best fair\\ '' .\n",
      "Since reporting to the command , his performance \\ '' declined from marginal to poor.\\ '' It reflects that the Veteran had been counseled numerous times for failure to complete training in submarines .\n",
      "In sum , the service personnel records reflect that the Veteran had performance and attitude problems for more than a year prior to discharge , and prior to his claimed in-service stressors of serving aboard a submarine .\n",
      "Rather than reflect that the Veteran was overworked and solely responsible for certain aspects of his job as a parts repair personnel , it reflects that he was unproductive and needed constant supervision.The Veteran has asserted that in April 1976 , he was in fear for his life due to a drill which he believed was an actual imminent collision with an enemy vessel .\n",
      "A Defense Personal Records Information Retrieval System report in response to a request for a deck log review reflects the following information : \\ '' We reviewed the March-May 1976 deck logs for the USS Theodore Roosevelt .\n",
      "The deck logs reveal that the submarine was in a Guam dry-dock March 8-16 , 1976 and underway for Special Operations with limited deck logs entries during the periods March 27-30 , April 5-25 , May 2-8 , and May 10-31 , 1976 .\n",
      "The deck logs do not document a no-notice collision alert drill during a combat patrol.\\ '' A copy of the ship 's deck log sheet reflects that on May 7 , [ 1976 ] ( three weeks after the Veteran 's alleged drill ) , the Veteran had a 1/4 inch by 1/8th inch laceration in his forehead .\n",
      "The prognosis was good and the treatment was a bandage and return to duty .\n",
      "The deck log is negative for any loss of consciousness .\n",
      "The earliest clinical evidence of an acquired psychiatric disability is more than twenty years after separation from service .\n",
      "The Board finds that , pursuant to the September 2014 Court Order granting the Joint Motion , further development is necessary prior to adjudication of the Veteran 's claims of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder , to include PTSD and major depression , and entitlement to a TDIU rating .\n",
      "The clinical evidence of record , including the Veteran 's December 2012 VA examination report , includes findings that the Veteran 's depression predated service .\n",
      "An earlier November 2011 VA examination report concluded that there \\ '' does not appear to be a connection between his current psychological difficulties which are apparent and his service in the Navy ... \\ '' In a December 2014 Remand Argument , it is claimed that \\ '' the Veteran 's stressors are sufficiently traumatic , especially considering the Veteran 's already delicate psychiatric constitution.\\ '' It is further claimed that \\ '' in-service events aggravated a pre-service psychiatric condition that was not noted on the Veteran 's military entrance examination.\\ '' Under 38 U.S.C.A .\n",
      "\\u00a7 1111 , a Veteran is entitled to a presumption of soundness on entry in service as to any disability not noted on examination for enlistment ; such presumption can be rebutted only by clear and unmistakable evidence .\n",
      "A history of a pre-service injury , of itself , is not a notation of a disability on service entrance , and does not suffice to rebut the presumption of soundness in the face of a normal clinical evaluation on service entrance .\n",
      "In addition , if the presumption of soundness is rebutted , the Veteran is entitled to a further presumption that the disability not noted on entry in ( but manifested during ) service was aggravated by service .\n",
      "This presumption likewise can be rebutted only by clear and unmistakable evidence ( of non-aggravation ) .The presumption of soundness applies only where there is evidence that a disease or injury was not noted upon entry into service manifested or was incurred in service .\n",
      "Once the presumption of soundness is applied , if the Secretary is unable to rebut the presumption , the disease or injury that manifested in service is deemed incurred in service , such that the second element of service connection is established .\n",
      "At that point , however , a veteran still must establish that he has a current disability that is related to the in-service injury or disease .\n",
      "This nexus determination is based on a weighing of the evidence by the preponderance of the evidence standard , with the benefit of the doubt given to the veteran .\n",
      "It is error to apply the presumption of soundness without first addressing or finding whether the Veteran 's psychiatric disability manifested in service .\n",
      "See Gilbert v. Shinseki , 26 Vet .\n",
      "App .\n",
      "48 , 54-55 ( 2012 ) Because the Veteran was clinically normal on May 1973 psychiatric evaluation for enlistment , he is entitled to a presumption of soundness on entry in service with respect to a psychiatric disorder if a psychiatric disorder was manifest during service .\n",
      "An examination that addresses the etiology of the Veteran 's current psychiatric disability taking into account the applicable legal presumptions is necessary.The December 2014 Remand Argument notes that the Veteran 's treatment records from D. S. , LCSW ( licensed clinical social worker ) , have not been obtained and provides the contact information for this clinician .\n",
      "Further , the most recent VA treatment records available for review are dated in October 2012 .\n",
      "VA should obtain all relevant VA and private treatment records which could potentially be helpful in resolving the Veteran 's claim .\n",

      "App .\n",
      "611 ( 1992 ) .The claim of entitlement to a TDIU rating is inextricably intertwined with the matter of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability , to include PTSD and major depression , and consideration of that issue must be deferred pending resolution of the service connection claim.Accordingly , the case is REMANDED for the following action:1 .\n",
      "Ask the appellant to identify all providers of mental health evaluation or treatment he has received , to include prior to his 1973 enlistment and after his 1976 separation from service and to provide all authorizations necessary for VA to obtain any private records of such evaluations and treatment that are not already associated with the record .\n",
      "The attention of the RO is specifically directed to records from the D. S. , LCSW .\n",
      "All updated VA treatment records should also be obtained .\n",
      "2 .\n",
      "Thereafter , the Veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination .\n",
      "The claims folder , including a copy of this remand , should be reviewed by the examiner , and the examination report should reflect that review .\n",
      "All appropriate tests should be conducted .\n",
      "The examiner must offer opinions to the following : ( a ) Please identify ( by medical diagnosis ) each psychiatric disability entity currently found , including whether the Veteran has depression and PTSD .\n",
      "Specifically , does the Veteran meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD ( including based on fear of hostile action ) ?\n",
      "If so , please identify the stressor and symptoms supporting such diagnosis .\n",
      "If PTSD is not diagnosed , indicate clearly what symptom ( s ) needed for such diagnosis is/are lacking .\n",
      "( b ) As to each currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder , please offer an opinion as to whether that disorder was manifest during service .\n",
      "In doing so , please address whether any of the performance/disciplinary problems which the Veteran had in service represented symptoms of a current psychiatric disability .\n",
      "( c ) If ( and only if ) a current psychiatric disorder was manifest during service , please offer an opinion as to whether is it clear and unmistakable ( obvious , manifest , or undebatable ) that the acquired psychiatric disorder that was present during service existed prior to active military service ?\n",
      "If it is determined that a psychiatric disorder did not exist prior to service , the examiner should reconcile such finding with the December 2012 VA examination report , which includes the finding that the Veteran 's depression predated service .\n",
      "( d ) If the acquired psychiatric disorder existed prior to active military service , is it also clear and unmistakable ( obvious , manifest , or undebatable ) that such disorder was not aggravated during or by his active military service beyond the condition 's natural progression ?\n",
      "Any clear and unmistakable ( obvious , manifest , or undebatable ) evidence which serves as the basis for any opinion must be specifically identified .\n",
      "( e ) If a current psychiatric disorder was not present during service then is it at least as likely as not ( 50 percent or greater probability ) that the current psychiatric disorder is otherwise etiologically related to the Veteran 's period of active service ?\n",
      "( f ) Do the diagnosed psychiatric disorders , including PTSD , prevent the Veteran from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation ? The opinions provided must specifically reflect consideration of the Veteran 's military performance evaluations and his post service VA and private treatment records and examination reports .\n",
      "The examiner must explain the rationale for all opinions in detail , citing to supporting clinical data and/or medical literature , as appropriate .\n",
      "3 .\n",
      "Thereafter , readjudicate the claims , to include entitlement to a TDIU rating .\n",
      "If any benefit sought on appeal remains denied , the Veteran and his attorney should be provided a supplemental statement of the case and afforded an opportunity to respond .\n",
      "The case should be returned to the Board for appellate review.The appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matters the Board has remanded .\n",

      "AnalysisThe Veteran asserts entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder .\n",
      "His symptoms have been variously diagnosed but primarily as PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder .\n",
      "Initially , and to the extent that PTSD has noted to have preexisted service and/or attributed to childhood trauma , to include on VA examination in December 1992 and November 2010 , the Board notes that a January 1964 Reserve examination report reflects psychiatric examination was normal .\n",
      "His neuropsychiatric status was assigned a profile of \\ '' 1.\\ '' See Odiorne v. Principi , 3 Vet .\n",

      "On the accompanying medical history , the Veteran denied having or having had frequent trouble sleeping , frequent or terrifying nightmares , depression or excessive worry , and nervous trouble of any sort .\n",
      "In addition , the August 1964 ACDUTRA separation examination report shows psychiatric examination was normal .\n",
      "His neuropsychiatric status was assigned a profile of \\ '' 1.\\ '' On the accompanying medical history he denied having or having had frequent trouble sleeping , frequent or terrifying nightmares , depression or excessive worry , and nervous trouble of any sort .\n",
      "Furthermore , and although a March 1971 VA treatment record notes inpatient treatment in 1967 with long standing anxiety symptoms diagnosed as chronic anxiety state , the May 1968 active duty service entrance examination report shows psychiatric examination .\n",
      "In addition , and although psychiatric impairment was noted , the June 1969 separation examination report shows psychiatric evaluation was normal , and his neuropsychiatric status was assigned a profile of \\ '' 1.\\ '' In light of these contradictory findings , and having reviewed the record , the Board concludes that there is not clear and unmistakable evidence that a psychiatric disorder existed prior to service entrance .\n",
      "Thus , the Veteran is presumed to have been in sound condition when entering service as to a psychiatric disorder.Service records tend to show that at least psychiatric symptoms manifested during service .\n",
      "Following his deployment to Vietnam in September 1968 , he was accompanied by a recommendation for limited duty and deployment only to a location where psychiatric outpatient treatment was available .\n",
      "In November 1968 , he was noted to be more reclusive , more depressed , and getting worse .\n",
      "After service , a December 1992 VA examination report reflecting a history of having come under small arms fire in a helicopter during service in Vietnam notes that the Veteran was transferred by helicopter on a weekly basis to psychiatric appointments .\n",
      "Although the June 1969 separation examination report shows psychiatric evaluation was normal , on the accompanying medical history the Veteran indicated that he had depression or excessive worry , memory loss , and nervous trouble.With respect to diagnosis , and although a November 2011 VA examination report reflects a diagnosis of somatoform disorder , a November 2010 VA examination report noting a history of the Veteran 's camp having regularly come under mortar attack during service in Vietnam reflects the Veteran meets the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD .\n",
      "Consistent with the November 2010 VA examiner 's opinion is the opinion of the July 2011 private physician who determined that the Veteran meets the criteria for not only a diagnosis of PTSD but also generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) .\n",
      "Both the July 2011 private report and the December 1992 VA examination report conclude that the most traumatic circumstance of the Veteran 's Vietnam service was related to the Veteran not being permitted to carry a gun due to his psychiatric disorder .\n",
      "The private report states that the Veteran felt terrified and feared for his life the entire time he was serving in Vietnam .\n",
      "The physician noted that PTSD is most severe in individuals such as the Veteran who have an underlying psychiatric disorder such as GAD .\n",
      "Based on this new July 2011 private treatment report , in conjunction with the other evidence of record , the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran has PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder related to service.Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran 's favor , the Board finds the evidence is in favor of the claim .\n",

      "REMANDWith respect to CUE , an April 2012 rating decision addresses CUE in a September 1971 rating decision .\n",

      "For example , in the February 1998 VA examination report , the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with major depression with psychotic features and stated that the Veteran described symptoms of major depression during service .\n",
      "In addition , while describing the Veteran 's diagnosis of major depression in a January 2002 letter , the Veteran 's private physician discussed the Veteran 's childhood trauma that was exacerbated by his military experience and led to a hospitalization for depression .\n",
      "Finally , in a September 2004 letter , the Veteran 's VA physician stated that the Veteran 's acquired psychiatric conditions \\ '' clearly intensified during his military experience.\\ '' Thus , VA has not met its burden to rebut the presumption of soundness , as the evidence is either favorable or in equipoise as to whether or not the Veteran 's acquired psychiatric disorder was aggravated by active service .\n",
      "Therefore , the second element of service connection is established and benefits may not be deducted on the basis of evidence of pre-existence of an acquired psychiatric disorder .\n",
      "See Wagner , 370 F.3d at 1096.As to the first and third elements of service connection , the Veteran has consistently been diagnosed with acquired psychiatric disorders since he was in service and throughout the pendency of this claim .\n",
      "More specifically , the diagnoses of PTSD and/or depression are noted in service treatment records ( when he was his spouse 's dependent ) dated September 1992 and October 1992 ; letters from private physicians dated November 1993 , January 1998 , January 2002 , and March 2002 ; and VA treatment records dated February 1998 ; March and August 2001 ; March , April , June , July , and December 2002 ; September and October 2003 ; February and September 2004 ; January , April , August , and October 2005 ; January , February , April , July , and November 2006 ; January , June , and September 2007 ; January and May 2008 ; April , May , July , September , and December 2010 ; January 2011 ; March , April , June , August , and October 2012 ; January , April , July , August , October , and November 2013 ; January , February , April , June , August , September , October , and December 2014 ; and January and March 2015 , as well as many others .\n",
      "Thus , the Veteran has a current diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder and it has been continuously treated since his time in service .\n",
      "A nexus between the Veteran 's current acquired psychiatric disorder and his period of active service is likewise established with the findings of aggravation reflected in the September 2004 letter from the Veteran 's VA physician .\n",

      "The Board finds that a review of the evidence of record , to include competent private and VA medical opinions , service treatment records ( STRs ) , and lay statements , reveals that the Veteran 's condition is etiologically related to the injury he sustained during service .\n",
      "As such , the Veteran 's claim for service connection must be granted .\n",
      "Generally , to prevail on a claim of service connection on the merits , there must be competent evidence of ( 1 ) current disability ; ( 2 ) medical , or in certain circumstances , lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury ; and ( 3 ) medical evidence or other competent evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury .\n",

      "Every veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined , accepted , and enrolled for service , except as to defects , infirmities , or disorders noted at the time of the examination , acceptance , and enrollment ; or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service .\n",

      "Thus , there is a rebuttable presumption of soundness unless a condition is noted at entry .\n",

      "VA 's General Counsel has held that to rebut the presumption of sound condition under 38 U.S.C.A .\n",
      "\\u00a7 1111 , VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence both that the disease or injury existed prior to service and that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service .\n",
      "VAOPGCPREC 3-2003 ( July 16 , 2003 ) ; see also Wagner v. Principi , 370 F.3d 1089 , 1096 ( Fed .\n",
      "Cir .\n",
      "2004 ) .The Board notes that the Veteran has continuously contended that his current symptomatic back condition was related or aggravated by an incident during service where his squad was instructed to jump into foxholes during a training exercise and another solider , who jumped into the same foxhole , landed on his back .\n",
      "As an initial matter , the Board finds that the evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran 's back condition clearly and unmistakably pre-existed his period of active duty service , and that there is certainly no clear and unmistakable evidence that the any such condition was not aggravated during his service .\n",
      "Preliminarily , the Board notes that the Veteran enlisted in May 1972 , entry examinations in his STRs noted no issues or pre-existing problems with his back upon entry .\n",
      "The report of medical history , completed by the Veteran himself also noted no issues with his back.In June 1972 , only a few weeks after entering service , the STRs reveal that the Veteran reported to sick-call with lower back pain ( denoted as LBP ) .\n",
      "Further treatment records for that time period noted treatment and testing for his back injury he sustained during training .\n",
      "Later in June 1972 , the Veteran 's condition was evaluated by the Army Medical Board , where it was determined that the Veteran 's back condition rendered him physically unfit for active service , and he was subsequently discharged from service .\n",
      "The Medical Board 's decision also noted that the Veteran 's condition was believed to have prevented him from physical civilian work prior to service .\n",
      "Related to this claim , the VA afforded the Veteran with two VA Compensation and Pension ( C & P ) examinations in May 2009 and January 2015 .\n",
      "Upon examination of the Veteran and his medical history , both VA examiners initially noted that the Veteran 's back condition more likely than not pre-existed his service .\n",
      "However , the Board finds that neither examiner provided an adequate level of affirmation of the Veteran 's pre-existing condition to rebut the Veteran 's presumption of soundness .\n",
      "In other words , the level of standard to rebut the Veteran 's presumption of soundness is clear and unmistakable , a far cry from as least likely as not .\n",
      "Short of that standard of proof and rationale offered by an examiner , such rebuttal under 38 U.S.C.A .\n",
      "\\u00a7 1111 , can not succeed .\n",
      "To this end , the Board notes that the Veteran has submitted several lay statements from his co-worker/classmates and his sports coach during high school , noting that they witnessed and knew of no evidence that the Veteran suffered from any type of back condition .\n",
      "While the Board understands that both such statements come from lay persons without the appropriate medical background and training to diagnose a back condition , the Board finds that such statements remain probative because of the circumstance of their , then , relationship .\n",
      "In other words , the Board finds that as the Veteran 's football teammate during high school , and his coach for football and track and field , both lay persons have a unique perspective in evaluating any restrictions of the Veteran 's physical abilities .\n",
      "In the same vein , the Board notes that the Veteran graduated from high school in 1971 , only a year before enlisting .\n",
      "Such temporal proximity only increases the validity and weight of the probative value of such statements establishing a sound physical condition prior to entering his active service .\n",
      "Finally , the weight of the competent evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran 's back condition was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated during service ; or the second prong of rebutting the presumption of soundness .\n",
      "In fact , the January 2015 VA examiner has also opined , that the injury in service did in fact aggravate/exacerbated any back condition the Veteran may or may not have had .\n",
      "As such , the Board finds that the evidence of record does not rise to the level as to rebut the presumption of soundness and an evaluation of service connection , on a direct basis must be made .\n",
      "As noted above , the threshold question for service connection must be the existence of a current disability .\n",
      "To this end , the Board finds that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a back condition , specifically spondylolisthesis of the L5-S1 with bilateral pars interarticularis defect .\n",
      "This diagnosis has been confirmed by VA examiners as well as the Veteran 's treating physicians and medical professionals .\n",
      "Therefore , the first element of service connection has been satisfied .\n",
      "The second prong of an in-service injury or incurrence is also well documented in the Veteran 's STRs .\n",
      "Specifically , notes in the Veteran 's STRs indicated the Veteran injured his back and suffered from low back pain during service .\n",
      "The Veteran has also consistently reported that his back was injured when a fellow solider jumped into the same foxhole he was in and landed on his back .\n",
      "Such evidence is ample to satisfy the in-service element for service connection .\n",
      "Finally , the third prong to establish service connection , also known as the nexus element , has also been established by the evidence of record .\n",
      "Here , there are both positive and negative medical opinions , regarding the Veteran 's current back condition .\n",
      "Regarding a nexus , the Board notes that the Veteran has submitted a private medical opinion from his treating medical professional , who attests to the fact that the Veteran 's current back condition was aggravated/exacerbated , or otherwise caused , by his injury to his back during service .\n",
      "Specifically , the Veteran 's long time chiropractor , F. A. , found that the Veteran 's current symptomatic condition was caused by a trauma , such as that described during his military service , and that such force exacerbated/caused his current back condition .\n",
      "See Medical Opinion from F. A. , D. C. , dated July 22 , 2008 .\n",
      "Conversely , the VA has also obtained two medical opinions that are seemingly against the above private opinion regarding nexus .\n",
      "The Veteran was afforded two VA C & P examination for this condition in May 2009 and January 2015 .\n",
      "In both examination reports , the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran 's current condition was simply a continuation of his back condition that pre-existed his active military service .\n",
      "In both instances , the VA examiners specifically cited the Army Medical Board findings of June 1972 that the Veteran was never actually physically fit for active service .\n",
      "Therefore , both VA examiners opined that such back condition could not be solely caused by the Veteran 's injury during service .\n",
      "The Veteran was afforded the first of these examinations in May 2009 , the examiner , after reviewing the claims file and examining the Veteran 's back , concluded that the Veteran 's condition pre-existed his military service .\n",
      "However , the Board finds that this examiner 's opinion to be inadequate .\n",
      "The VA examiner failed to provide any rationale regarding his conclusion that the Veteran 's back condition pre-existed his military service , as he based his nexus conclusion solely on the Army Medical Boards evaluation .\n",
      "That examiner also failed to provide any opinion regarding any aggravating/exacerbating effects the Veteran 's in-service injury may have had on his current condition .\n",
      "As such , this opinion is inadequate and carries little probative weight .\n",
      "The Veteran 's second VA C & P examination , in January 2015 , provides a confusing and nearly contradictory conclusion and rationale .\n",
      "Specifically , the examiner concluded that it was less likely than not that the Veteran 's condition was incurred or caused by the claimed in-service injury , explaining that such condition was not caused by an acute injury .\n",
      "However , later in the report , the examiner also noted in another worksheet that the condition was not proximately due to any service-connected disability , and explicitly opined that the Veteran 's present back condition \\ '' appears to be due to his back injury of June 1972 , \\ '' during his active duty service , as well as post-service back injuries .\n",
      "The Board finds that two opinions to be at best inadequate and nearly contradictory , offering almost a positive nexus opinion in the latter opinion .\n",
      "As such , the Board finds that this opinion , like the VA examination preceding it , to be inadequate and offers little probative value .\n",
      "Consequently , the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise regarding a nexus between the Veteran 's current condition and his injury during his military service .\n",
      "Therefore , in affording the Veteran the benefit-of-the-doubt , the Veteran 's claim of service connection for a back condition must be granted .\n",
      "Service Connection - Acquired Psychiatric Condition , PTSD The Veteran claims , essentially , that his PTSD , or any acquired psychiatric condition , to include major depressive disorder , is due to his back condition , which has been service connected herein .\n",

      "He maintains that his variously diagnosed psychiatric disorder stems from the trauma of potentially being deployed to a combat zone in Vietnam while stationed in Japan during service in 1974 .\n",
      "Initially , the Board notes that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant 's description of the claim , reported symptoms , and the other information of record .\n",
      "Clemons v. Shinseki , 23 Vet .\n",
      "App .\n",
      "1 ( 2009 ) .\n",
      "The Veteran specifically identified PTSD as the claimed disability in his December 2010 claim .\n",
      "However , as noted in the Board 's October 2014 remand , other potential psychiatric disorders reflected in the record result in a claim with a broader scope than solely PTSD.The Veteran 's DD FORM 214 reflects his military occupational specialty ( MOS ) is listed as \\ '' DSTE\\ '' ( Digital Subscriber Terminal Equipment ) maintenance repairman .\n",
      "Although there is no indicia of service in Vietnam , five months and 19 days of foreign service is noted , and service treatment records document service in Japan .\n",
      "Further , the June 1970 service entrance examination report shows that psychiatric evaluation was normal , and on the accompanying medical history , he denied having or having had depression or excessive worry and nervous trouble of any sort .\n",
      "A January 1973 service treatment records reflects a diagnosis of chest wall syndrome secondary to anxiety .\n",
      "In addition , the August 1974 separation examination report , which was accomplished at Yokota Air Base in Japan , reflects two episodes of chest pain diagnosed as chest wall syndrome secondary to anxiety , one of which was noted to have occurred in 1974 .\n",
      "Additionally , and although a December 2010 VA treatment record reflects an impression of PTSD based on the Veteran 's detailed , self-report of numerous traumas experienced during alleged service in Vietnam , the July 2012 VA examiner clarified that the Veteran did not serve in Vietnam , noting the Veteran 's admission that he never had orders to rebuild a damaged communication center in Vietnam .\n",
      "\\ '' Instead , he states that his memories and nightmares are of the time he was stationed in Japan 'just sitting and waiting and anticipating you might get orders . '\n",
      "It was noted that the Veteran recalled that he was fearful that he might be sent to Vietnam .\n",
      "Moreover , both the July 2012 and February 2011 VA examiners specifically determined that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD based upon clinical testing .\n",
      "Although the Veteran 's VA psychiatrist noted in April 2016 that the Veteran 's psychiatric symptoms were related to his fear of deployment to high threat zones during service , with a corresponding daily fear of death , culminating in his current symptoms , which were noted to be very similar to those experienced in individuals with PTSD , the diagnosis entered was chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features , not PTSD .\n",
      "The Board notes that although the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms , medical expertise is necessary to provide a diagnosis of any certain psychiatric disorder .\n",
      "See , e.g. , Young v. McDonald , 766 F.3d 1348 , 1353 ( Fed .\n",
      "Cir .\n",
      "2014 ) ( \\ '' PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence .\n",
      ".\n",
      ".\n",
      "is competent and sufficient to identify.\\ '' ) .\n",
      "Here , the probative evidence establishes that the Veteran neither served in Vietnam nor met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD at any time during the appeal period .\n",
      "Thus , the Board finds that service connection for PTSD is not warranted .\n",
      "With respect to diagnoses other than PTSD , and although a December 2011 letter from the Veteran 's VA psychiatrist notes depressive disorder , not otherwise specified ( NOS ) , the July 2012 VA examiner determined that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder .\n",
      "In addition , the February 2015 VA examination report reflecting a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder notes that the conflict in the evidence made it difficult to determine whether the Veteran 's psychiatric symptoms were related to service .\n",
      "The examiner added that although the Veteran may believe that his symptoms are due to his experiences during service in Japan , he likely engages in significant misattribution .\n",
      "On the other hand , in addition to chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features diagnosed by the Veteran 's VA psychiatrist in April 2016 and noted to be related to service , the February 2017 VHA addendum opinion states that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran 's recurrent manifestations of anxiety have been exacerbated by service , at least in part .\n",
      "To the extent that the February 2017 VHA addendum opinion raises the possibility of a psychiatric disability existing prior to service entrance , in the absence of clear and unmistakable evidence showing that a psychiatric disorder existed prior to service entrance and was not aggravated by such service , the presumption of soundness at service entrance is not rebutted .\n",

      "On Reports of Medical History completed by the Veteran in June 1984 , August 1985 , August 1986 and June 1989 , he denied ever having a head injury .\n",
      "In short , the Veteran 's claimed stressor of being attacked and hit in the head over and over is not credible .\n",
      "Far from being verified , this stressor has , in fact , been contradicted by the objective evidence of record .\n",
      "In addition , there is no current diagnosis of PTSD of record .\n",
      "In September 2006 , May 2009 , July 2011 , screens for PTSD were negative ; screen for PTSD in June 2013 was positive .\n",
      "In addition , two PTSD screens administered on the same day in May 2009 , resulted in one administered by a psychiatrist being negative and one administered by a nurse being positive .\n",
      "A September 2009 , Axis I diagnosis included \\ '' r/o PTSD.\\ '' Although some treatment records reference a diagnosis of PTSD , none of the PTSD diagnoses are made in conformance with the DSM-IV or V criteria , and as noted above , the single Axis I diagnosis including PTSD is recorded as \\ '' r [ ule ] o [ ut ] PTSD.\\ '' Subsequent Axis I diagnoses included mood disorder due to medical condition and major depressive disorder in addition to alcohol abuse , cannabis abuse , and tobacco use disorder .\n",
      "Thus , the Board finds that the reference to \\ '' r/o PTSD\\ '' and the noted \\ '' cva with PTSD\\ '' in the VA treatment records can not be interpreted as a finding that PTSD is a current disability , or that it has been present at any specific time pertinent to the appeal .\n",
      "In summary , the Board finds that the most competent , credible , and probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran currently or at any point during the appeal period has received a valid diagnosis of PTSD .\n",
      "The Board further finds that the Veteran 's claimed stressor of being hit in the head over and over is not credible and neither stressor has been verified .\n",
      "The weight of the competent evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD , and there is no independent evidence corroborating the Veteran 's statement as to the occurrence of his claimed stressors .\n",
      "As such , the evidence of record does not establish a DSM-V diagnosis of PTSD based upon a verified stressor event .\n",
      "Thus , for the foregoing reasons , the claim for service connection for PTSD must be denied .\n",
      "In reaching this conclusion , the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine ; however , as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran 's claim , that doctrine is not applicable.Pes PlanusOn his Report of Medical Examination in September 1975 for the purpose of enlistment , the Veteran 's feet were noted to be abnormal and he was diagnosed as having \\ '' pes planus 2\\u00a7 , asymptomatic.\\ '' On the Report of Medical History completed by the Veteran in conjunction with his entrance physical , he denied ever having foot trouble .\n",

      "He is the recipient of numerous awards and decorations , to include the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Purple Heart with an Oak Leaf Cluster.This matter comes before the Board of Veterans ' Appeals ( Board ) on appeal from a February 2011 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Regional Office ( RO ) in Louisville , Kentucky , which denied service connection for PTSD.The record reflects that the Veteran has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder in addition to PTSD .\n",
      "The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ( Court ) has held that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental health disability that could reasonably be encompassed by the claimant 's description of the claim , reported symptoms , and the other information of record .\n",

      "In November 2010 , the attending psychologist continued to diagnose a depressive disorder , mentioning the Veteran 's struggle with VA for benefits and general references to past military experiences .\n",

      "The psychologist acknowledged that the Veteran 's combat experiences would be sufficient to meet the event criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD , but that no diagnosis of a mental health disorder was appropriate because the symptoms were limited to expected reactions to stressors such as the death of his first wife and unwanted forced retirement due to medical issues and related financial distress , and not to the events in military service .\n",
      "The Veteran stopped VA outpatient mental health treatment in February 2011 but returned to seek primary care in April 2012 .\n",

      "In a follow-up examination the same day , a VA psychiatrist noted that the Veteran 's mood was \\ '' down but not overly so\\ '' and that symptoms of PTSD were greatly reduced .\n",
      "In subsequent treatment encounters in July 2012 and August 2012 , the attending psychiatrist diagnosed both major depressive disorder and related PTSD with diminishing symptoms that did not interfere with activities .\n",
      "However , in August 2012 , the psychiatrist noted that the Veteran was not depressed on that occasion .\n",
      "In October 2012 , the VA social worker noted some improvement in isolative behaviors , anger issues , and disturbed sleep with the use of medication , but that the Veteran continued to display a depressed mood caused by thoughts of his fellow soldiers killed in Vietnam , how he was treated during service , his physical disabilities , and the death of his first wife .\n",
      "In November 2012 , the Veteran was diagnosed with major depressive disorder .\n",
      "VA treatment records dated from February 2013 through May 2013 show diagnoses of major depressive disorder and PTSD , and ongoing treatment for such disorders from the Veteran 's treating psychiatrist , psychologist , and social worker.During the September 2013 Board hearing , the Veteran testified that he was currently under treatment in an intensive program at a VA mental health clinic for PTSD , major depression , and anxiety disorder since April 10 , 2013 , and that his psychiatrist had associated the disorders with his combat service .\n",
      "The Board finds that service connection for PTSD and major depressive disorder is warranted .\n",
      "As an initial matter , the Board finds that the Veteran 's reports of his traumatic events during combat in Vietnam and current symptoms are competent because they are observable by lay persons and have been accepted without challenge by all clinicians and the January 2011 examiner and are consistent with his service records .\n",
      "Moreover , as the Veteran served in combat , his lay statements are sufficient to verify his in-service stressors.The Board acknowledges that there is competent evidence both for and against a finding that the Veteran has a current psychiatric disorder related to his in-service combat stressors .\n",
      "The VA psychologist in January 2011 provided a detailed history and comprehensive report of his examination in which he acknowledged the combat events and found that they met the traumatic event criteria .\n",
      "However , he found that the Veteran did not have any diagnosed psychiatric disorder on that one occasion , but did not have access to or mention the nature of the VA outpatient care that was provided prior to his examination .\n",
      "On the other hand , outpatient clinicians in 2010 diagnosed depression and possible PTSD , albeit with little detailed rationale .\n",
      "Nevertheless , the clinicians acknowledged the combat events as well as the death of the Veteran 's first wife , his workplace injuries and surgery , and his involuntary retirement .\n",
      "In 2012 , the outpatient clinicians affirmatively diagnosed mild symptoms of depression and PTSD without conditional language , but again with little detailed analysis or rationale , referring to both physical disabilities as a cause for depression and combat events as causes for nightmares , intrusive memories , and irritability .\n",
      "However , beginning in February 2013 , VA treatment records reflect diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder , and ongoing treatment for such disorders from the Veteran 's treating psychiatrist , psychologist , and social worker .\n",
      "Moreover , the Veteran 's testimony regarding a 2013 intensive mental health treatment program for PTSD , depression , and anxiety , which he reported had been related to his in-service combat stressors , is competent and credible in light of his ongoing treatment for such disorders .\n",
      "Therefore , resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran , the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence shows that diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder were rendered during portions of the pendency of the Veteran 's claim and such were , at least in part , related to traumatic events during combat in Vietnam .\n",
      "Consequently , service connection for such acquired psychiatric disorders is warranted .\n",

      "Specifically , in his September 2007 claim , the Veteran asserts that he never experienced mental issues before service , but \\ '' became easily irritated and alarmed during service and it has never diminished.\\ '' In his October 2007 stressor statement , the Veteran listed four stressors .\n",

      "1996 ) .Here , the multiple contradictions in the Veteran 's evidence lead the Board to conclude that the alleged incidents and stressors did not occur .\n",
      "First , the Veteran expressly denied experiencing psychiatric symptoms in service in his April 1977 and May 1977 Reports of Medical History , wherein he checked boxes indicating that he did not have , and had never had , depression or excessive worry , loss of memory or amnesia , or nervous trouble of any sort .\n",
      "See Curry v. Brown , 7 Vet .\n",
      "App .\n",
      "59 , 68 ( 1994 ) ( contemporaneous evidence has greater probative value than subsequently reported history ) .\n",
      "Second , in April 1977 and May 1977 Reports of Medical Examination , clinicians found that the Veteran was psychiatrically normal .\n",
      "See Buczynski v. Shinseki , 24 Vet.App .\n",
      "221 , 224 ( 2011 ) ( noting that where there is a lack of notation of medical condition or symptoms where such notation would normally be expected , the Board may consider this as evidence that the condition or symptoms did not exist ) .\n",
      "Third , the Veteran 's counseling records were for academics , not stress-as the Veteran inaccurately asserted in a February 2008 letter to VA. For example , in a June 1977 service personnel record a counselor opined that : I have personally interviewed this SM and found him to have a good attitude towards the Army .\n",
      "However , he has a serious academic problem .\n",
      "His ability to read and comprehend the material in his AIT course is extremely poor , and his exam grades indicated that he will develop [ ] into a marginal soldier at best .\n",
      "Recommendation : I do n't feel that this SM can obtain an MOS and recommend he be discharged.Similarly , the Veteran 's own contemporaneous assessment reflected academic , rather than psychiatric , concerns , as described by an in-service supervisor in his service personnel records : He says that he does n't know what the problem is but guesses [ that the test is ] too hard .\n",
      "I agree with him-it is too hard for him and he should not be in a service organization where his and other persons ' lives may depend upon his ability to respond logically and rapidly to requirements .\n",
      "He tried the Active Army and could not pass the tests.Fourth , the Veteran 's stressor statements to VA clinicians and examiners are often unrelated to , or in direct contradiction with , his stressor statements in support of his claim .\n",
      "For example , the Veteran told a treating VA psychiatrist in September 2007 that he had not seen the recruit shoot a drill sergeant , but rather had heard about it .\n",
      "This conflicts with the Veteran 's October 2007 stressor statement wherein he stated that \\ '' I witness [ ed ] Pvt .\n",
      "[ name omitted ] trying to kill [ an ] instructor by drawing his weapon on [ an ] instructor.\\ '' Additionally , the Veteran told his treating VA psychiatrist in November 2008 that he remembered one surgeon scraping another with a metal brush in service , causing bleeding in his body .\n",
      "This appears to be a variant of his October 2007 assertion that \\ '' I witness [ ed ] in Ft. Rucker a group of Privates force bathing another Private with a steel brush.\\ '' Furthermore , the Veteran told a VA psychologist in August 2007 that he had been revolted and horrified in service by one of his superiors who kept on his desk a large jar of pickled ears from dead NVA and Vietcong soldiers ; the Veteran never listed this stressor in his claim.Based on the foregoing , the Board concludes that the Veteran 's reports of in-service incidents and stressors lack credibility.In March 2013 , VA obtained a medical opinion as to the Veteran 's claimed PTSD and psychiatric disorders .\n",
      "The clinician opined that \\ '' It is LESS LIKELY THAN NOT that the Veteran 's claimed mental health condition , to include PTSD , incurred , was caused by or proximately due to his 6 months in military service.\\ '' In support of her opinion , the clinician relied on the absence of verification of the Veteran 's stressors ; the in-service counseling report showing discharge due to an academic deficiency ; and the absence of \\ '' medically based scientific evidence found in his service record to indicate that his short time in military service ... [ was ] the underlying cause of his current diagnoses of PTSD and Depression.\\ '' The clinician also opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran 's mental health condition is caused by , proximately due to , or related to his service-connected bilateral lower extremity disabilities , to include peripheral neuropathy and vascular disease , because \\ '' [ t ] here is no current literature or scientifically based medical evidence to support such a nexus.\\ '' The Board finds that the clinician 's opinion is competent because she is qualified through education , training , or experience to offer medical diagnoses , statements , or opinions .\n",

      "Also , the clinician 's etiological opinions are credible based on their internal consistency and her duty to provide truthful opinions .\n",
      "The Board further finds that the March 2013 clinician 's opinion is most probative because she considered the Veteran 's medical records and discussed his medical history , provided unequivocal and conclusive opinions , and offered clear reasoning for her conclusions .\n",

      "The VA examiner opined that a \\ '' veteran can have PTSD symptoms which are present , but not at a severity of frequency necessary to meet diagnostic criteria.\\ '' The VA examiner 's rational points towards this being the case in the previous VA examinations .\n",

      "Concerning the private treatment records it was noted that they \\ '' related stressor to military service but did not provide enough specifics to show diagnostic criteria was met.\\ '' Whatever the case was previously , the VA examiner concluded that the October 2010 VA examination revealed the Veteran presently \\ '' presenting symptoms in sufficient frequency and severity to meet diagnostic criteria\\ '' for a diagnosis of PTSD .\n",

      "The Board acknowledges that the October 2010 VA examiner noted that private treatment records related stressors to military service but did not provide enough specifics to show diagnostic criteria for PTSD were met .\n",

      "As such , the Board finds the evidence is at least in equipoise regarding a current diagnosis of PTSD ; therefore , the Board has determined that a current diagnosis of PTSD is present in the instant case .\n",
      "Next , the Board must determine whether the record establishes that the Veteran 's reported in-service stressors occurred .\n",
      "As noted Veteran contends that multiple noncombat-related stressors occurred at Fort Sill , Oklahoma causing his PTSD .\n",

      "The DPRIS inquiry could not confirm the location of the death other than that it occurred in the United States .\n",
      "However , an undated news article submitted by the Veteran reveals that Sergeant W.C.B .\n",
      "died at Fort Sill in a motor vehicle accident .\n",
      "Additionally , an October 2010 statement from M.W. , Jr. , who claims to have witnessed the incident , indicates the Veteran was present and witnessed the accident .\n",
      "With this in mind , the Board finds the Veteran lay testimony is supported by credible evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred .\n",
      "The remaining question , therefore , is whether there is competent medical evidence linking the Veteran 's PTSD to his in-service stressor .\n",
      "In diagnosing PTSD , the October 2011 VA examiner specifically noted two in-service stressors that contributed to the PTSD diagnosis .\n",
      "One of the stressors was the death of a Sergeant by motor vehicle accident .\n",

      "49 ( 1990 ) , the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ( Court ) found that \\ '' a Veteran need only demonstrate that there is an 'approximate balance of positive and negative evidence ' in order to prevail.\\ '' Further , the Court specifically stated that entitlement need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt , by clear and convincing evidence , or by a fair preponderance of the evidence .\n",
      "Under the benefit of the doubt doctrine established by Congress , when the evidence is in \\ '' relative equipoise , the law dictates that the Veteran prevails.\\ '' Id .\n",

      "\\u00a7 3.300 ( b ) ( 1 ) .To address whether the Veteran 's current respiratory problems were related to his in-service treatment or otherwise caused by his military service , the matter was referred for a VA medical opinion .\n",
      "In an April 2011 opinion , a VA examiner concluded that it is less likely than not that the Veteran 's in-service treatment for colds and sinusitis is related to any current respiratory condition .\n",
      "The examiner explained that the Veteran was treated in service for upper respiratory infections , which are a common illness and not indicative of a chronic disability .\n",
      "The examiner further opined that the cause of the Veteran 's lung disorder is likely a long history of heavy smoking .\n",

      "Furthermore , although the April 2011 VA examiner considered whether the Veteran 's treatment for colds and sinusitis on several occasions during his active service was evidence of a chronic disability , the examiner explained that upper respiratory infections such as the Veteran was treated for are a common illness and his treatment for it in service should not be considered evidence of a chronic disability .\n",
      "The examiner concluded that it is less likely than not that the Veteran 's current respiratory problems had onset in service or were caused by or related the Veteran 's active military service .\n",
      "Again , the Veteran has not submitted any medical evidence to the contrary .\n",
      "While current VA and private treatment records reflect treatment for a number of respiratory complaints , none of the Veteran 's treatment provider has opined that these conditions are related to the Veteran 's service .\n",

      "Thus , there is no indication that anything in service could have potentially caused or aggravated his respiratory disorder , aside from his use of tobacco products .\n",
      "Moreover , the examiner opined that there were no \\ '' intercurrent ( [ o ] ccuring in addition to and usually altering the course of another disease ) causes unrelated to his military service.\\ '' Although the Board has now service-connected the Veteran 's PTSD , there is no indication that this disability has aggravated the Veteran 's respiratory disability .\n",
      "To the extent that the Veteran has offered his own opinion concerning the etiology of his respiratory disability , he has not demonstrated that he has any knowledge or training in determining the etiology of such conditions .\n",
      "In other words , he is a layman , not a medical expert .\n",

      "The Board finds that the question of whether the Veteran currently has a respiratory disability due to his active military service is too complex to be addressed by a layperson .\n",
      "This connection or etiology is not amenable to observation alone .\n",
      "Rather it is common knowledge that such relationships are the subject of extensive research by scientific and medical professionals .\n",
      "Hence , the Veteran 's opinion of the etiology of his current disability is entitled to little to no probative weight .\n",
      "The Board gives greater weight to the contemporaneous medical evidence and the opinion of the VA examiner.Although the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran 's argument that he began smoking in service due , in part , to the cigarettes he was provided by the military , Congress has spoken to this issue in 38 U.S.C.A .\n",

      "While the RO attempted to corroborate the Veteran 's testimony through official sources , service personnel records do not confirm the Veteran 's report of the incident in November 1977 , and correspondence with the Irvine Police Department dated in November 2010 and November 2012 shows that they do not keep records of assaults for more than 10 years .\n",
      "The Board finds , however , that the Veteran has provided sufficient corroborating evidence in the form of lay statements provided by Gunnery Sargent W.C. A March 2009 statement from W.C. shows that he and the Veteran were stationed together in El Toro , California in 1977 , and that they went to the pub together to play pool during the incident in question .\n",
      "W.C. more recently submitted a notarized affidavit in November 2015 in which he describes the same incident in more detail .\n",
      "W.C. 's statements indicate that while he and the Veteran were playing pool , a civilian stranger came up to the Veteran and started acting aggressively .\n",
      "In response , the Veteran prepared to leave and return to base and was in the parking lot when the stranger pulled a rifle out of the trunk of his car , pointed it at the Veteran , and told him , \\ '' Today , you are going to die.\\ '' W.C. stated that he witnessed the incident from the doorway of the pub .\n",
      "The bartender was able to talk the man down , and the Veteran and W.C. ran back to base while he was distracted .\n",
      "They reported the incident to the Barrack Sergeant , who was later informed that the police had been called and removed the man from the premises .\n",
      "The Board finds that W.C. 's statement corroborates the occurrence of the Veteran 's reported in-service assault .\n",

      "In this regard , October 2008 VA treatment records document \\ '' PTSD-type symptoms\\ '' and one clinician indicated the need to \\ '' rule out PTSD\\ '' as a diagnosis .\n",
      "Thereafter , PTSD-like symptoms and a history of PTSD were noted during treatment in November 2008 .\n",
      "However , despite these notations , there is no indication in the record that the Veteran has ever been diagnosed with PTSD by a VA or private clinician , nor was he diagnosed with PTSD by the VA psychologist who conducted the March 2015 examination.Conversely , review of the record reveals that the Veteran has been diagnosed with several acquired psychiatric disorders other than PTSD including : unspecified depressive disorder , major depression , anxiety disorder not otherwise specified ( NOS ) , personality disorder NOS , and substance abuse disorders , in sustained remission .\n",
      "Thus , the first requirement for establishing service connection , a current disability , has been met .\n",
      "The Veteran 's service treatment records reveal no treatment for or diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder , and his separation examination revealed no psychiatric abnormalities .\n",
      "Moreover , there is no evidence the Veteran has ever been diagnosed with a psychosis .\n",
      "However , in written documents and in his Board hearing testimony , the Veteran contends that his acquired psychiatric disorder is the result of witnessing a shipmate fall overboard while stationed on the USS Constellation CVA 64 in approximately March 1975 .\n",
      "While the AOJ attempted to verify such stressor , it was unsuccessful .\n",
      "Thus , to establish service connection , there must be probative evidence linking his currently diagnosed psychiatric disorders with any instance of his military service .\n",
      "Upon review of the evidence , the Board finds the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim.In this regard , in March 2015 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with his claim for service connection .\n",
      "Following an interview with the Veteran , a review of the record , and a mental status examination , the examiner diagnosed an unspecified depressive disorder and substance abuse disorders , in sustained remission .\n",
      "The examiner noted the Veteran 's reports that he received mental health treatment in service , but noted ( as does the Board ) that there is no indication of such treatment in the Veteran 's service treatment records .\n",
      "The examiner also noted the Veteran 's reports of being fearful in service and his unverified stressor of seeing a fellow sailor fall overboard .\n",
      "Nevertheless , the examiner opined that the Veteran 's depressive disorder was not related to his service and that his depressive symptoms are related to a \\ '' long history of personality features and/or his substance abuse history.\\ '' The Board finds that the opinion of the VA examiner provided after reviewing the claims file and examining the Veteran is highly probative as it reflects consideration of all relevant facts and the examiner provided a detailed rationale for the conclusion reached .\n",
      "See Nieves-Rodriguez , supra ( holding that it is the factually accurate , fully articulated , sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes to the probative value of a medical opinion ) ; Stefl , supra .\n",
      "There is no competent medical evidence to the contrary.To the extent the Veteran believes that he suffers from a psychiatric disorder that is related to service , as a lay person , he has not shown that he has specialized training sufficient to render such an opinion .\n",

      "In this regard , the diagnosis and etiology of psychiatric disorders are matters not capable of lay observation , and require medical expertise to determine .\n",
      "Accordingly , his opinion as to the diagnosis or etiology of the current psychiatric symptomology is not competent medical evidence .\n",
      "The Board finds the opinion of the VA examiner to be significantly more probative than his lay assertions.Moreover , the Board recognizes that the Veteran reported at his March 2015 examination and elsewhere that he began abusing drugs during service and that the examiner attributed his current depressive symptoms to the Veteran 's drug abuse history .\n",
      "However , both 38 C.F.R .\n",

      "To the extent that the provider suggested that a stressor during reserve service might be linked to a current psychiatric disorder , these treatment notes are favorable to the claim .\n",
      "However , in the absence of objective evidence corroborating this stressor , the medical opinion based on the uncorroborated stressor is of little probative value.A December 2000 VA mental health clinic note indicates that the Veteran had continued depressive symptoms , with marked isolation and reduced interest in past friends or hobbies .\n",

      "The criteria for diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder was not met , the examiner concluded , because it was not clear that she ever had a distinct period of two weeks when the psychotic symptoms persisted but she was free of mood symptoms .\n",
      "The examiner opined , in essence , that no current psychiatric disorder was linked to the Veteran 's service or any incident thereof .\n",
      "The opinion is well reasoned and provides an accurate summary of the record .\n",
      "The opinion is persuasive evidence against the claim .\n",
      "A January 2003 VA PTSD outpatient report noted that the Veteran discussed several motor vehicle accidents in which she was involved .\n",
      "She reported an incident in the military in which she fell from a vehicle and slid 50 feet into an intersection .\n",
      "She stated that anxiety attacks were a barrier to driving .\n",

      "She has not indicated when or where she was treated for injuries sustained in such a motor vehicle accident in the 10 years since she mentioned such a stressor .\n",
      "The Veteran has not provided any additional details which could be used to verify the motor vehicle accident .\n",

      "SSA awarded the Veteran disability benefits in a favorable 2003 decision .\n",
      "The award letter provides no discussion of a specific stressor or a link between the Veteran 's service and an acquired psychiatric disability .\n",
      "This award , and the underlying medical evidence , provides no additional information that is favorable or unfavorable to the claim.An April 2003 VA outpatient note indicates that the award of SSA disability benefits reminded the Veteran of past hardships including being raped , homeless , unemployed , and depressed .\n",
      "This event led to a resurgence of memories associated with the rape , including the name of one of her attackers , T. , as well as a woman who later helped protect her from the rapists , E. The social worker who authored the note indicated that memories of her rape appeared to have been the core of the Veteran 's current dysphoria .\n",
      "This treatment note raises additional inconsistencies in the information provided by the Veteran .\n",
      "Although the Veteran told the provider she remembered names of two servicemembers involved in the incident , the Veteran has never provided any name of a fellow former servicemember for purposes of development of her claim for compensation .\n",
      "Her statements at the April 2003 VA treatment visit are inconsistent with her actions since that time .\n",
      "That inconsistency undermines her credibility.The Board has considered all the evidence of record regarding an alleged sexual assault that the Veteran reports occurred during her active service .\n",
      "The fact that no service department records of the incident have been located does not weigh against the possible occurrence or the Veteran 's credibility , since VA regulations recognize that such incidents , if reported , were not uniformly documented .\n",
      "However , in the October 2003 stressor statement , the Veteran stated that she could not remember the names of any individuals involved .\n",
      "That report is in conflict with the April 2003 treatment report .\n",
      "The Veteran contends that she had symptoms of a psychiatric disability soon after her discharge from active duty and soon after reserve service was completed .\n",
      "The Veteran is competent to report events during active service .\n",

      "The Veteran provided varying accounts of stressor events to VA adjudicators and treatment providers during the lengthy pendency of the appeal .\n",
      "Given the inconsistencies between the Veteran 's reports and the objective evidence of record , the Veteran 's credibility is diminished .\n",
      "The Veteran 's service personnel records are associated with the claims file .\n",
      "Review of the service personnel records shows no indication of disciplinary actions , adverse personnel actions , drop in performance , or requests for reassignment .\n",
      "During active service she states that she was awarded the outstanding recruit award , her August 1969 performance evaluation was excellent .\n",
      "The Veteran reported , at the November 2002 VA examination , that she enjoyed both active service and reserve service .\n",
      "The Veteran reported that she chose to be discharged from active service in August 1969 due in part to the sexual abuse , but her performance obviously did not deteriorate in any way due to the alleged assault .\n",
      "Importantly , in August 1969 , just three months after the alleged sexual assault occurred in May 1969 , the Veteran received an excellent performance review.The Veteran enlisted in 1983 for six additional years of reserve service and was promoted .\n",
      "Her reserve component service performance record was also excellent and unblemished .\n",
      "It reflects only high achievement and excellent work ethic .\n",
      "Significantly , VA outpatient treatment records from 2000 and 2001 do not contain any allegation of any kind of military sexual trauma or abuse .\n",
      "The first evidence of a report of military sexual trauma is from August 2002 , after the Veteran filed her claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD .\n",
      "Notably , prior to August 2002 , the Veteran specifically alleged other stressors , to include the helicopter crash , seeing dead bodies , and generalized nightmares about people she knew who may have died serving in Vietnam .\n",
      "This is not necessarily significant in and of itself , yet , combined with the other credibility evidence of record ; the Board finds that it diminishes her credibility somewhat in that her descriptions regarding her stressors have changed at various examinations.The Veteran was referred to the VA Mental Health Clinic in September 2002 following a positive military sexual trauma and PTSD screening .\n",
      "It was at that time she was diagnosed with PTSD due to the military sexual trauma .\n",
      "In contrast , the VA psychiatrist who conducted November 2002 VA examination , two months later , concluded that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD .\n",
      "The Board also points out that the examiner had access to and reviewed the Veteran 's claims file , to include her prior psychiatric diagnoses , hallucinations , and alleged stressors .\n",
      "As noted above , the November 2012 VA examination report is lengthy , accurate , and provides the reasoning for the examiner 's conclusions .\n",
      "In contrast , the VA psychologist who provided the September 2002 diagnosis did not reference review of any records , but , rather , assigned a diagnosis based upon the Veteran 's account of her own history.Also probative regarding the Veteran 's credibility is the fact that she has told different examiners different facts regarding her history .\n",
      "At the November 2002 VA exam , she stated that in 1987 approximately she started feeling depressed .\n",
      "At the September 2002 PTSD examination , she stated that she has been having mental health issues ever since service .\n",
      "The various psychiatrists and psychologists who have noted PTSD as due to military sexual trauma appear to have done so based only on the Veteran 's self-reported history , rather than review of the complete record .\n",
      "A medical professional 's opinion based on a post-service examination of a veteran is not competent evidence that an in-service stressor occurred .\n",

      "Further , because such medical opinions are not based on review of the evidence they do not constitute verification of military sexual trauma under 38 C.F.R .\n",
      "\\u00a7 3.304 ( f ) ( 4 ) .As a layperson , the Veteran can certainly provide an account of her symptoms and feelings at any given time .\n",
      "However , service personnel records , and later reserve service records in particular , weigh heavily against the Veteran 's September 2002 account that she has had mental health problems ever since her active service .\n",
      "As mentioned previously , the stellar performance evaluation reports during her reserve service generally negate the contention that mental health problems , such as psychosis , were present at that time .\n",
      "In addition , the Veteran has claimed that her PTSD is a result of a stressor involving her witnessing and picking up human remains of Marines who had been killed in a helicopter crash in Camp Pendleton .\n",
      "This stressor is a major event , yet remains unverified after all attempts .\n",
      "While the case was on remand status following the 2009 Remand from the Board , the RO was instructed to accomplish all development action in order to corroborate the stressor .\n",
      "The RO acquired a Command Chronology from the Commanding General , Marine Corps Base , Camp Pendleton , California from July 1968 through December 1968 ; no helicopter crash was reported .\n",
      "The Veteran then provided statements indicating that , during her reserve service , in 1990 , she performed post-crash duties at the site of a helicopter crash in which two female Marines were \\ '' torn to pieces.\\ '' No objective confirmation of this stressor has been located .\n",
      "It is not credible that a helicopter crash in 1990 which resulted in fatalities would not have been documented by the service department or the base at which it is alleged to have occurred , or that no other information , such as a newspaper article , reports of aviation accidents , or the like , would be located .\n",
      "The Board finds it very probative that the Veteran has described vividly remembering witnessing a crash involving either 2 ( October 2004 VA outpatient records ) , 8 ( November 2002 VA examination ) , or 13 ( October 2000 VA Mental Health Clinic outpatient records , Addendum ) dead Marines , to include her roommates , yet there is no objective confirmation of the event .\n",
      "In particular , the Board notes the Veteran 's statements that \\ '' the media\\ '' reported on this crash , but their reports were inaccurate .\n",

      "The record establishes that the Veteran performed her active service honorably and well , and was highly regarded during her reserve component service .\n",
      "The pursuit of this claim for the 15 years of the pendency of this appeal establishes that the Veteran sincerely believes that a current psychiatric disorder is linked to her service.Nevertheless , the preponderance of the evidence is unfavorable to the claim .\n",
      "The available service personnel records , although incomplete , show no indictors of a stressor , such as disciplinary problems or behavioral changes .\n",

      "It was concluded that exhaustive attempts failed to corroborate a stressor and no further development should be conducted .\n",

Moore , Esq.ATTORNEY FOR THE BOARDC .\n",
      "Ryan , Associate CounselINTRODUCTIONThe Veteran served on active duty from January 1968 to December 1969 .\n",
      "This matter comes before the Board of Veterans ' Appeals ( Board ) on appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Regional Office ( RO ) in St. Petersburg , Florida.The Board notes that in November 2012 , the Veteran initially requested a hearing .\n",
      "At the time , the Veteran 's representative , the Florida Department of Veteran Affairs ( FDVA ) requested that if the Veteran did not receive a hearing , the claims file should be returned to the FDVA so it might prepare an informal hearing presentation .\n",
      "In December 2015 , the Veteran retained a private lawyer , Joseph R. Moore .\n",
      "In March 2016 , Mr. Moore cancelled the Veteran 's hearing request .\n",
      "Because the Veteran is no longer represented by the FDVA , the Board finds it unnecessary to return the claims folder .\n",
      "In addition , the Board acknowledges the Veteran 's representative 's request for a stay of proceedings and a copy of the Veteran 's claims file .\n",
      "However , given the disposition below , the Board finds no prejudice will attach by issuing this decision , as it is fully favorable to the Veteran regarding the issue on appeal .\n",
      "FINDING OF FACTThe Veteran suffers from PTSD that is linked to a confirmed in-service stressor.CONCLUSION OF LAWThe criteria for service connection for PTSD are met .\n",

      "For the following reasons , the Board finds service connection is warranted.Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service .\n",

      "\\u00a7 3.303 ( a ) .\n",
      "Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things : ( 1 ) a current disability ; ( 2 ) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury ; and ( 3 ) a causal relationship , i.e. , a nexus , between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability .\n",

      "38 C.F.R .\n",
      "\\u00a7 3.303 ( d ) .\n",
      "In addition to the general requirements for service connection , PTSD claims require : ( 1 ) medical evidence diagnosing the condition ; ( 2 ) a link , established by medical evidence , between current symptoms and an in-service stressor ; and ( 3 ) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred .\n",
      "38 C.F.R .\n",

      "38 C.F.R .\n",
      "\\u00a7 3.304 ( f ) .The evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a stressor during service to support a diagnosis of PTSD will vary depending upon whether the Veteranengaged in \\ '' combat with the enemy , \\ '' as established by recognized military combat citations or other official records .\n",
      "See Cohen v. Brown , 10 Vet .\n",
      "App .\n",
      "128 ( 1997 ) .\n",
      "If VA determines the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the alleged stressor is combat-related , then the Veteran 's lay testimony or statement is accepted as conclusive evidence of the stressor 's occurrence and no further development or corroborative evidence is required , provided that such testimony is found to be \\ '' satisfactory\\ '' -i.e. , credible , and \\ '' consistent with the circumstances , conditions , or hardships of service.\\ '' See 38 U.S.C.A .\n",

      "App .\n",
      "163 , 164 ( 1996 ) .\n",
      "If , however , the Veteran 's stressor is unrelated to participation in combat , then lay testimony , in and of itself , is insufficient to corroborate the stressor .\n",
      "The record must contain credible supporting information from an independent source that corroborates his testimony or statements , such as service records .\n",

      "\\u00a7 3.304 ( f ) ( 3 ) ) .\n",
      "The revised regulation essentially eases the requirement that there be corroboration of a claimed in-service stressor .\n",
      "Under this standard , if a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran 's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran 's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor , provided the stressor is consistent with the places , types , and circumstances of the Veteran 's service , the Veteran 's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the stressor.When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter , VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant .\n",

      "Alemany v. Brown , 9 Vet .\n",
      "App .\n",
      "518 , 519 ( 1996 ) .A review of the facts reveals the following : in October 2002 , the Veteran underwent a Compensation and Pension ( C & P ) examination for PTSD , in which the examiner determined the Veteran suffered from PTSD , as well as a depressive disorder .\n",
      "The Veteran explained his PTSD worsened in 2000 , when he switched from working night shift to day shift , and he was forced to frequently interact with co-workers and family members .\n",
      "The stress of such interactions increased his temper , and he became verbally abusive toward his family members .\n",
      "Shortly thereafter , he entered treatment at the VA and enrolled in private mental health services where he was diagnosed with depressive disorder and PTSD.The Veteran informed the examiner he dreamed often , but only occasionally about Vietnam .\n",
      "Following his discharge , he often awoke from sleep screaming and in a panicked state , and he still experienced daily , recurrent thoughts of Vietnam .\n",
      "Moreover , he was forced to actively avoid veteran associations or discussions of combat .\n",
      "He tended to avoid crowds or groups of people because of feelings of potential danger or threat and heightened anxiety .\n",
      "He avoided others out of a fear of losing control and angry impulses .\n",
      "Lastly , he experienced trouble controlling his temper and struggled to interact with others at work and with his family .\n",
      "Socially , the Veteran maintained one or two friendships.The examiner determined the Veteran was alert and oriented to all spheres .\n",
      "His appearance was clean , and he was adequately dressed and groomed .\n",
      "His speech was coherent and of a normal rate , rhythm , and tone .\n",
      "He displayed good eye contact and demonstrated appropriate interpersonal interaction .\n",
      "His thought process was logical and goal directed , and he exhibited no overt or reported signs of psychosis , delusion , or hallucination.The examiner concluded that the Veteran suffered from both PTSD and a depressive disorder .\n",
      "The Veteran 's experiences in Vietnam served as his traumatic stressor .\n",
      "The examiner believed the Veteran 's PTSD developed following his discharge from the service.Following the examination , the Veteran was consistently and continuously diagnosed with PTSD , continued to report symptoms of PTSD , and continuously received both in-patient and out-patient PTSD counseling from 2002 until 2009.In December 2007 , the Veteran submitted a statement , concluding that his PTSD caused him to mentally break down at VA hospitals , receive disciplinary charges at work , and forced him to undergo hospitalization for psychiatric care in January 2005.In December 2009 , the Veteran underwent a C & P examination for PTSD .\n",
      "However , the Veteran did not complete the exam due to his mental angst .\n",
      "Prior to the examination , the Veteran had asked for and received from his treating psychologist a note stipulating that his wife should be allowed to attend the C & P examination with him .\n",
      "Upon arriving for the C & P examination , the examiner informed him his wife was not allowed to attend .\n",
      "This upset the Veteran to such a degree the examiner was forced to end the examination.In December 2009 , the Veteran 's daughter submitted a statement in which she concluded her father 's PTSD had worsened over the past few months , and she was very worried about his anger .\n",
      "She stated that she never knew what was going to happen around him , and although he continued to receive treatment at the VA , his condition had worsened , not improved.In March 2012 , the Veteran received another C & P examination for PTSD , in which the examiner determined the Veteran did not suffer from PTSD .\n",
      "She concluded that the Veteran did not meet PTSD criteria under the DSM-IV Criteria B ( re-experiencing ) , Criteria C ( avoidance and numbing ) , or Criteria D ( hyperarousal ) .\n",
      "The examiner indicated that under Criteria B ( re-experiencing ) , the Veteran did not suffer from recurrent distressing thoughts of the event , or recurrent distressing dreams of the event .\n",
      "Under Criteria C ( avoidance and numbing ) , the Veteran did not actively avoid activities , places , or people that arouse recollections of the trauma .\n",
      "Under Criteria D ( hyperarousal ) , the examiner indicated the Veteran did not suffer from irritability or outbursts of anger .\n",
      "Moreover , the examiner could not explain why the Veteran had been diagnosed with PTSD by past treatment providers because she could not review how those providers arrived at a diagnosis .\n",
      "Lastly , she opined that the Veteran merely suffered from isolated symptoms of PTSD which were not sufficient to make a PTSD diagnosis under the DSM-IV .\n",
      "In June 2012 , the Veteran submitted a statement explaining that he had received continuous PTSD diagnoses for the past 10 to 12 years , and he continued to suffer from the disease.The Board begins by noting that due to the Veteran 's combat service in Vietnam , the RO conceded the existence of in-service stressors .\n",
      "Thus , a discussion concerning stressors is unnecessary.The Board finds that the evidence supports the Veteran 's claim of service connection for PTSD .\n",
      "First , the record demonstrates the Veteran served in Vietnam , and the RO conceded that the Veteran 's in-service stressors occurred .\n",
      "Second , the Veteran 's VA treating physicians believe the Veteran suffers from PTSD .\n",
      "For more than the past decade , the Veteran has complained of and sought treatment for PTSD , and the providers whom the Veteran saw on a daily basis concluded the Veteran suffered from PTSD .\n",
      "Last , the October 2002 C & P examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and concluded that the Veteran 's PTSD stemmed from his service in the military.In March 2012 , the Veteran underwent a C & P examination for PTSD , in which the examiner concluded the Veteran did not suffer from PTSD .\n",
      "In making this finding , the examiner determined the Veteran did not suffer from the following : recurrent distressing thoughts of the event ; recurrent distressing dreams of the event ; an avoidance of activities , places , or people that arouse recollections of the trauma ; or irritability or outbursts of anger .\n",
      "The record , however , directly contradicts those findings .\n",
      "In the October 2002 statement , the Veteran informed the examiner he experienced daily , recurrent thoughts of Vietnam , occasional nightmares , and that he actively avoided veterans and activities associated with Vietnam .\n",
      "Moreover , the Veteran explained to the examiner that he frequently suffered from irritability and anger outbursts with his family and co-workers , and the Veteran continued to assert that in his lay statements .\n",
      "In December 2009 , the Veteran 's daughter submitted a letter to the RO in which she stated she was worried about her father 's worsening anger , unpredictability , and irritability .\n",
      "Due to the fact that the March 2012 examiner mischaracterized the Veteran 's symptoms and behavior , the Board finds the examination and examiner 's conclusion less than probative .\n",

      "App .\n",
      "458 , 460-61 ( 1993 ) ( finding that medical opinions based on incomplete or inaccurate factual premises are not probative ) .\n",
      "Accordingly , given the Veteran 's treating physicians ' multiple diagnoses of PTSD , the Board finds the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran has PTSD and its relation to service.In addition to the general requirements for service connection , PTSD claims require : ( 1 ) medical evidence diagnosing the condition ; ( 2 ) a link , established by medical evidence , between current symptoms and an in-service stressor ; and ( 3 ) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred .\n",

      "In September 2010 , the Board remanded the claims for further development , including a VA examination .\n",
      "In a June 2011 decision , the Board denied the claims for service connection of PTSD and a psychiatric disorder other than PTSD .\n",
      "The Veteran appealed the Board 's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ( Court ) .\n",
      "In December 2011 , the Court granted a Joint Motion to Vacate and Remand the Board 's decision , finding that the Board failed to discuss the application of the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C.A .\n",

      "His medical records show that he has been treated for psychiatric symptoms since 1984 , and has been hospitalized on several occasions as a result of suicide attempts .\n",
      "He asserts that his continuing symptoms are related to the death of his brother during service .\n",
      "The Board finds that service connection is warranted for an acquired psychiatric disorder , diagnosed as PTSD , MDD , dysthymia and depression NOS .\n",
      "Establishing service connection generally requires medical or , in certain circumstances , lay evidence of ( 1 ) a current disability ; ( 2 ) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury ; and ( 3 ) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability .\n",

      "Although there is evidence of record that the Veteran experienced some psychiatric symptoms prior to service , his May 1974 entrance examination revealed no psychiatric disorder .\n",
      "Additionally , even though an October 2010 VA examiner opined that the Veteran 's PTSD and depression had their onset prior to service , the January 2013 VA examiner opined that it was not undebatable that the Veteran 's PTSD and depression pre-existed service .\n",
      "Thus , the Board finds that presumption of soundness applies in this matter and has not been rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence .\n",
      "The issue in this case is whether the Veteran 's PTSD and/or depression had an onset in service or is due to an event occurring in service .\n",
      "The Board finds that service connection for PTSD is warranted because the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD linked to the death of his brother during service .\n",
      "There is no dispute that the Veteran 's brother died in October 1974 , while the Veteran was serving on active duty .\n",
      "The issue for adjudication is whether he has a diagnosis of PTSD that is linked to his brother 's death .\n",
      "The Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise .\n",
      "The Veteran submitted private medical opinions in September 2012 , February 2013 and April 2014 in which clinical psychologist J. Smith opined that the Veteran met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD , and that the diagnosis of PTSD is linked to the death of his brother .\n",
      "See September 2012 , February 2013 and April 2014 Private Medical Opinions of J. Smith , Ph.D .\n",
      "The Veteran 's VA medical records also show a diagnosis of PTSD during the appeal period .\n",
      "The Board finds this evidence sufficient to establish a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with the applicable regulations .\n",
      "See Cohen v. Brown , 10 Vet .\n",
      "App .\n",
      "128 , 140 ( 1997 ) .\n",
      "The Board notes that the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners both opined that the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under either the DSM IV or the DSM 5 because his stressor fails to meet Criterion A necessary for PTSD diagnosis .\n",
      "The November 2013 VA examiner also opined that the Veteran denied current significant re-experiencing ( Criterion B ) symptoms and further denied significant avoidance and impairment in functioning symptoms regarding his reported stressor .\n",
      "However , in his April 2014 addendum opinion , Dr. Smith addressed these criteria , stating that the death of the Veteran 's brother did meet Criterion A because the Veteran was confronted with the death of his brother and his response to this news was one of horror and helplessness .\n",
      "Dr. Smith further noted that the diagnosis of PTSD reflects continuing symptoms of poor sleep , marked and continuing anxiety and depression , continued intrusion of \\ '' triggering\\ '' experiences and events such as contact with his family or hearing reports on the news of young people dying in a hit and run situation , and avoidance of the area of where his brother died .\n",
      "The October 2010 VA examiner also noted that the Veteran reported experiencing intrusive thoughts related to his brother on a weekly basis , and avoidance of therapy because the he \\ '' does n't like to bring up the past.\\ '' Thus , the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise on the issue of whether the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD relating to his brother 's death .\n",

      "See Layno v. Brown , 6 Vet .\n",
      "App .\n",
      "465 ( 1994 ) .\n",
      "The Board observes that there is evidence of record that contradicts the Veteran 's assertion that his symptoms started in service and have been recurrent since that time .\n",
      "Most notably , he was examined multiple times in service and found to have no psychiatric disorder .\n",
      "See February 1975 Report of Mental Status Evaluation ; see also May 1975 Mental Hygiene Consultation Report .\n",
      "However , the Veteran reported that his psychiatric examination was very brief .\n",
      "Additionally , Dr. Smith opined that the examination \\ '' appeared to be simply designed to meet an administrative requirement and did not constitute a full psychiatric examination\\ '' because the examination report showed no evidence that the examiner explored the Veteran 's reaction to his brother 's death .\n",
      "See April 2014 Addendum Private Medical Opinion of J. Smith .\n",
      "Thus , the Board does not find the lack of a psychiatric diagnosis on examination during service to be determinative .\n",
      "After weighing the evidence and affording the Veteran the benefit of all reasonable doubt , the Board finds his reports regarding the onset and continuation of his depressive symptoms to be credible .\n",
      "As noted by the March 2016 , the Veteran 's reports of ongoing psychiatric symptoms have been consistent .\n",
      "In August 1989 , when discussing the history of his depression , he stated that his brother 's death had been very traumatic for him .\n",
      "See August 1989 VA Medical Record .\n",
      "At a February 2006 group therapy session , he talked about how his brother 's death was \\ '' still bothering him.\\ '' See February 2006 VA Medical Record .\n",
      "During an April 2006 examination performed in connection with his Social Security disability claim , he stated that he thought his psychological symptoms were due , at least in part , to the death of his brother .\n",
      "See April 2006 Psychological Examination Report .\n",
      "The Board notes that he reported having \\ '' problems\\ '' beginning in 1984 , but that during the same time frame he also reported first seeking treatment in 1984 and first experiencing an impact in his ability to work in 1984 .\n",
      "Thus , it appears that he did not mean that his symptoms started at that time , but that he became significantly impaired in 1984 .\n",
      "At his October 2007 hearing , he again reported having an onset of depressive symptoms in service .\n",
      "See October 2007 Hearing Tr .\n",
      "at 2-4 .\n",
      "During the October 2010 VA examination , he reported \\ '' increased\\ '' depression after the loss of his brother .\n",
      "He also reported that he attempted suicide in the early 1970s after service , and that his suicide attempts have been primarily by overdose , carbon monoxide poisoning and a few times by placing a gun to his head without pulling the trigger .\n",
      "This report is consistent with his statements made during his interview with Dr. Smith ( as reported in the September 2012 independent evaluation report ) , the statements captured in his February 2013 affidavit , and the statements made during the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examinations .\n",
      "In light of the consistencies in the Veteran 's reports concerning the onset and continuity of his symptoms , the Board finds his testimony credible.Because the Board finds the Veteran 's reports of his recurrent psychiatric symptoms to be credible , it affords more probative value to the opinions of the Dr. Smith , and less probative value to the opinions of the VA examiners .\n",
      "The November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners opined that the Veteran 's depression was not related to his brother 's death because there were no contemporaneous medical records confirming his reports of depressive symptoms prior to 1984 .\n",
      "The November 2013 VA examiner also reasoned that there were no mention of mental health issues in the letters the Veteran submitted from friends and family in support of his discharge from service .\n",
      "In general , a VA examiner may not rely on the absence of evidence as negative evidence , particularly where there is no indication that the fact should have been recorded .\n",
      "See , e.g. , Fountain v. McDonald , 27 Vet .\n",

      "In this case , as noted by Dr. Smith , \\ '' absence of a formal record of care in no way proves that symptoms were not present , nor does it suggest that care was not needed- only that formal care had not as yet been sought.\\ '' April 2014 Private Addendum Opinion of J. Smith .\n",
      "Additionally , there is no reason for the Board to determine that there would be reports of psychiatric symptoms contained in the letters provided by the Veteran 's friends and family in support of his request for discharge from service based on his religious beliefs .\n",
      "The evidence of record shows that the purpose of those letters was to corroborate the Veteran 's assertion that his change in religious viewed prevented him from serving on active duty ; consequently , it is not expected that any discussion of depressive symptoms would be included in such letters .\n",
      "For these reasons , the Board affords the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners ' negative nexus opinions little probative value .\n",
      "As all three elements necessary to establish service connection have been met , service connection for depression ( diagnosed as MDD , dysthymia and depressive disorder NOS ) is warranted .\n",

      "Hughes, CounselINTRODUCTIONThe Veteran had active military service from May 1973 to October 1976.These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2012 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in Portland, Oregon.\n",
      "In December 2013, the Veteran testified at a videoconference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.\n",
      "A transcript of that hearing is of record.In March 2014, the Board issued a decision denying service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and major depression, and entitlement to a TDIU rating.\n",
      "The Veteran appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).\n",
      "In September 2014, the Court granted the Joint Motion for Partial Remand (Joint Motion); vacated that portion of the March 2014 Board decision which denied service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and major depression, and entitlement to a TDIU rating; and remanded the appeal to the Board for additional action consistent with the Joint Motion.The appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).\n",
      "VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.REMANDThe Veteran contends that he has PTSD and/or depression due to his service aboard a submarine, sleep-deprivation in service, \\\"hazing\\\", and a submarine drill.The Veteran's STRs were negative for any findings of, or treatment for, an acquired psychiatric disability or symptoms of such.\n",
      "The STRs contain complaints of a lump in his breast (April 1974, May 1974), a headache (June 1974), back pain (June 1974), an ingrown toe nail (four visits in July 1976), congestion, sore throat (August 1976) low back pain (four visits in September 1976), and low back pain (October 1976).\n",
      "The records are negative for any complaints of fatigue, or lack of sleep.The Veteran was assigned to Great Lakes, Illinois from July 1973 to October 1973.\n",
      "He was assigned to the USS Albert David at some point in 1974.\n",
      "He was assigned to the Naval Nuclear Power School at Mare Island, California from April 1974 to September 1974.\n",
      "He was assigned to the NUCPWR (Nuclear Power) Plant Operator School at Idaho Falls, Idaho from October 1974 to April 1975.\n",
      "He served about the USS Proteus from July 1975.\n",
      "He served about the USS Theodore Roosevelt from approximately September 1975 to October 1976.\n",
      "In October 1976, it was recommended that the Veteran not be reenlisted and that he be discharged for unsuitability (i.e.\n",
      "apathy, defective attitude, and inability to expend effort effectively).\n",
      "The Veteran's enlisted performance record reflects that he had a professional performance rating of 3.6 in June 1974, and 3.4 in September 1974, April 1975, and July 1975, with a final trait average of 3.45.\n",
      "He had a military behavior rating of 3.8 in June 1974, 3.6 in September 1974, 3.2 in April 1975, and 3.4 in July 1975, with a final trait average of 3.5.\n",
      "He had a military appearance rating of 3.8 in June 1974, 3.6 in September 1974, and 3.4 in April 1975 and July 1975, with a final trait average of 3.55.\n",
      "For adaptability, he had a 3.8 in June 1974, and 3.4 in September 1974, April 75, and July 1975, with a final trait average of 3.5.\n",
      "An evaluation report for the period March 1974 to September 1974 reflects that the Veteran had low and declining performance, inconsistent effort, lackadaisical attitude on occasion, marginal motivation, and satisfactory military behavior.\n",
      "The Board notes that this was prior to his service on a submarine and was while he was attending the Naval Nuclear Power School at Mare Island, California.An evaluation report for a period ending in April 1975 reflects that the Veteran had completed prototype training and compared to other trainees of the same rate and experience, his rate of qualification progress was fair, his watch standing performance was fair, and his qualifications were good.A service record reflects that on July 21, 1976 and July 22, 1976, the Veteran failed to go at the time prescribed to his appointed place of duty.\n",
      "Again, this was prior to his time aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt.Another service record reflects that on August 24, 1976, August 26, 1976, August 27, 1976, August 30, 1976, and September 3, 1976, the Veteran failed to go to the appointed places of duty.\n",
      "An August 1976 performance evaluation report reflects the following:Since reporting aboard, [the Veteran] has experienced problems adapting to the demanding job of operating a nuclear power plant.\n",
      "He has been delinquent in both departmental and ship's qualification since reporting aboard.\n",
      "[The Veteran] has shown very little effort in completing qualification even though he has been counselled by his supervisors numerous times.\n",
      "When [the Veteran] was assigned the duty of divisional Repair Parts Petty Officer, constant supervision was necessary to ensure that assigned tasks were carried out.\n",
      "[The Veteran] has demonstrated little initiative in directing others and his negative attitude has also been reflected toward the naval service.\n",
      "[The Veteran] is an individual who desires isolation from others.\n",
      "He has been observed and counseled many times about unproductive use of his time when he should have been working on his qualifications or supply duties.\n",
      "[The Veteran] does not take pride in his personal appearance when in uniform and has to be constantly prodded to ensure he meets the minimum standard of dress and grooming.\n",
      "[the Veteran] has a good knowledge of both written and oral English and he supports the goals of Equal Opportunity.\n",
      "He is not recommended for advancement or for reenlistment.\n",
      "It further reflects, as follows:[The Veteran] was prematurely relieved of his duties as Repair Parts Petty Officer due to his lack of responsibility.\n",
      "[The Veteran] was also placed on a remedial study program to allow him to catchup on his qualification and become an effective member of the division.\n",
      "[The Veteran] has made unsatisfactory progress in completing this study program.\n",
      "[The Veteran] has consistently proven his unreliability by arriving late for duty numerous times.\n",
      "Although he has received Commanding Officers' Non-Judicial Punishment for these infractions, and has been counselled, he continues to reject authority and go his own way.A September 1976 Department of the Navy memorandum reflects that the Veteran was recommended for disqualification from submarine duty.\n",
      "It notes that the Veteran was absent for an inspection due to a lack of concern for his duties.\n",
      "A few days later, he was late for quarters several times and missed a muster.\n",
      "The report reflects that the Veteran had been given non-judicial punishment, but did not respond positively.\n",
      "The memorandum reflects that the Veteran had reported to the command in September 1975 from Nuclear Power training in Idaho Falls, after a three month assignment.\n",
      "His performance at the School was noted to have been \\\"inconsistent, lackadaisical, and at best fair\\\".\n",
      "Since reporting to the command, his performance \\\"declined from marginal to poor.\\\"  It reflects that the Veteran had been counseled numerous times for failure to complete training in submarines.\n",
      "In sum, the service personnel records reflect that the Veteran had performance and attitude problems for more than a year prior to discharge, and prior to his claimed in-service stressors of serving aboard a submarine.\n",
      "Rather than reflect that the Veteran was overworked and solely responsible for certain aspects of his job as a parts repair personnel, it reflects that he was unproductive and needed constant supervision.The Veteran has asserted that in April 1976, he was in fear for his life due to a drill which he believed was an actual imminent collision with an enemy vessel.\n",
      "A Defense Personal Records Information Retrieval System report in response to a request for a deck log review reflects the following information: \\\"We reviewed the March-May 1976 deck logs for the USS Theodore Roosevelt.\n",
      "The deck logs reveal that the submarine was in a Guam dry-dock March 8-16, 1976 and underway for Special Operations with limited deck logs entries during the periods March 27-30, April 5-25, May 2-8, and May 10-31, 1976.\n",
      "The deck logs do not document a no-notice collision alert drill during a combat patrol.\\\" A copy of the ship's deck log sheet reflects that on May 7, [1976] (three weeks after the Veteran's alleged drill), the Veteran had a 1/4 inch by 1/8th inch laceration in his forehead.\n",
      "The prognosis was good and the treatment was a bandage and return to duty.\n",
      "The deck log is negative for any loss of consciousness.\n",
      "The earliest clinical evidence of an acquired psychiatric disability is more than twenty years after separation from service.\n",
      "The Board finds that, pursuant to the September 2014 Court Order granting the Joint Motion, further development is necessary prior to adjudication of the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and major depression, and entitlement to a TDIU rating.\n",
      "The clinical evidence of record, including the Veteran's December 2012 VA examination report, includes findings that the Veteran's depression predated service.\n",
      "An earlier November 2011 VA examination report concluded that there \\\"does not appear to be a connection between his current psychological difficulties which are apparent and his service in the Navy...\\\"   In a December 2014 Remand Argument, it is claimed that \\\"the Veteran's stressors are sufficiently traumatic, especially considering the Veteran's already delicate psychiatric constitution.\\\"  It is further claimed that \\\"in-service events aggravated a pre-service psychiatric condition that was not noted on the Veteran's military entrance examination.\\\"  Under 38 U.S.C.A.\n",
      "\\u00a7 1111, a Veteran is entitled to a presumption of soundness on entry in service as to any disability not noted on examination for enlistment; such presumption can be rebutted only by clear and unmistakable evidence.\n",
      "A history of a pre-service injury, of itself, is not a notation of a disability on service entrance, and does not suffice to rebut the presumption of soundness in the face of a normal clinical evaluation on service entrance.\n",
      "In addition, if the presumption of soundness is rebutted, the Veteran is entitled to a further presumption that the disability not noted on entry in (but manifested during) service was aggravated by service.\n",
      "This presumption likewise can be rebutted only by clear and unmistakable evidence (of non-aggravation).The presumption of soundness applies only where there is evidence that a disease or injury was not noted upon entry into service manifested or was incurred in service.\n",
      "Once the presumption of soundness is applied, if the Secretary is unable to rebut the presumption, the disease or injury that manifested in service is deemed incurred in service, such that the second element of service connection is established.\n",
      "At that point, however, a veteran still must establish that he has a current disability that is related to the in-service injury or disease.\n",
      "This nexus determination is based on a weighing of the evidence by the preponderance of the evidence standard, with the benefit of the doubt given to the veteran.\n",
      "It is error to apply the presumption of soundness without first addressing or finding whether the Veteran's psychiatric disability manifested in service.\n",
      "See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet.\n",
      "App.\n",
      "48, 54-55 (2012)Because the Veteran was clinically normal on May 1973 psychiatric evaluation for enlistment, he is entitled to a presumption of soundness on entry in service with respect to a psychiatric disorder if a psychiatric disorder was manifest during service.\n",
      "An examination that addresses the etiology of the Veteran's current psychiatric disability taking into account the applicable legal presumptions is necessary.The December 2014 Remand Argument notes that the Veteran's treatment records from D. S., LCSW (licensed clinical social worker), have not been obtained and provides the contact information for this clinician.\n",
      "Further, the most recent VA treatment records available for review are dated in October 2012.\n",
      "VA should obtain all relevant VA and private treatment records which could potentially be helpful in resolving the Veteran's claim.\n",
      "See Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.\n",
      "App.\n",
      "78, 81-82 (1990); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet.\n",
      "App.\n",
      "611 (1992).The claim of entitlement to a TDIU rating is inextricably intertwined with the matter of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD and major depression, and consideration of that issue must be deferred pending resolution of the service connection claim.Accordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:1.\n",
      "Ask the appellant to identify all providers of mental health evaluation or treatment he has received, to include prior to his 1973 enlistment and after his 1976 separation from service and to provide all authorizations necessary for VA to obtain any private records of such evaluations and treatment that are not already associated with the record.\n",
      "The attention of the RO is specifically directed to records from the D. S., LCSW.\n",
      "All updated VA treatment records should also be obtained.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Thereafter, the Veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination.\n",
      "The claims folder, including a copy of this remand, should be reviewed by the examiner, and the examination report should reflect that review.\n",
      "All appropriate tests should be conducted.\n",
      "The examiner must offer opinions to the following:(a) Please identify (by medical diagnosis) each psychiatric disability entity currently found, including whether the Veteran has depression and PTSD.\n",
      "Specifically, does the Veteran meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD (including based on fear of hostile action)?\n",
      "If so, please identify the stressor and symptoms supporting such diagnosis.\n",
      "If PTSD is not diagnosed, indicate clearly what symptom(s) needed for such diagnosis is/are lacking.\n",
      "(b)  As to each currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder, please offer an opinion as to whether that disorder was manifest during service.\n",
      "In doing so, please address whether any of the performance/disciplinary problems which the Veteran had in service represented symptoms of a current psychiatric disability.\n",
      "(c) If (and only if) a current psychiatric disorder was manifest during service, please offer an opinion as to whether is it clear and unmistakable (obvious, manifest, or undebatable) that the acquired psychiatric disorder that was present during service existed prior to active military service?\n",
      "If it is determined that a psychiatric disorder did not exist prior to service, the examiner should reconcile such finding with the December 2012 VA examination report, which includes the finding that the Veteran's depression predated service.\n",
      "(d)  If the acquired psychiatric disorder existed prior to active military service, is it also clear and unmistakable (obvious, manifest, or undebatable) that such disorder was not aggravated during or by his active military service beyond the condition's natural progression?\n",
      "Any clear and unmistakable (obvious, manifest, or undebatable) evidence which serves as the basis for any opinion must be specifically identified.\n",
      "(e)  If a current psychiatric disorder was not present during service then is it at least as likely as not (50 percent or greater probability) that the current psychiatric disorder is otherwise etiologically related to the Veteran's period of active service?\n",
      "(f)  Do the diagnosed psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, prevent the Veteran from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation?The opinions provided must specifically reflect consideration of the Veteran's military performance evaluations and his post service VA and private treatment records and examination reports.\n",
      "The examiner must explain the rationale for all opinions in detail, citing to supporting clinical data and/or medical literature, as appropriate.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Thereafter, readjudicate the claims, to include entitlement to a TDIU rating.\n",
      "If any benefit sought on appeal remains denied, the Veteran and his attorney should be provided a supplemental statement of the case and afforded an opportunity to respond.\n",
      "The case should be returned to the Board for appellate review.The appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matters the Board has remanded.\n",

      "AnalysisThe Veteran asserts entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder.\n",
      "His symptoms have been variously diagnosed but primarily as PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder.\n",
      "Initially, and to the extent that PTSD has noted to have preexisted service and/or attributed to childhood trauma, to include on VA examination in December 1992 and November 2010, the Board notes that a January 1964 Reserve examination report reflects psychiatric examination was normal.\n",

      "On the accompanying medical history, the Veteran denied having or having had frequent trouble sleeping, frequent or terrifying nightmares, depression or excessive worry, and nervous trouble of any sort.\n",
      "In addition, the August 1964 ACDUTRA separation examination report shows psychiatric examination was normal.\n",
      "His neuropsychiatric status was assigned a profile of \\\"1.\\\"  On the accompanying medical history he denied having or having had frequent trouble sleeping, frequent or terrifying nightmares, depression or excessive worry, and nervous trouble of any sort.\n",
      "Furthermore, and although a March 1971 VA treatment record notes inpatient treatment in 1967 with long standing anxiety symptoms diagnosed as chronic anxiety state, the May 1968 active duty service entrance examination report shows psychiatric examination.\n",
      "In addition, and although psychiatric impairment was noted, the June 1969 separation examination report shows psychiatric evaluation was normal, and his neuropsychiatric status was assigned a profile of \\\"1.\\\"  In light of these contradictory findings, and having reviewed the record, the Board concludes that there is not clear and unmistakable evidence that a psychiatric disorder existed prior to service entrance.\n",
      "Thus, the Veteran is presumed to have been in sound condition when entering service as to a psychiatric disorder.Service records tend to show that at least psychiatric symptoms manifested during service.\n",
      "Following his deployment to Vietnam in September 1968, he was accompanied by a recommendation for limited duty and deployment only to a location where psychiatric outpatient treatment was available.\n",
      "In November 1968, he was noted to be more reclusive, more depressed, and getting worse.\n",
      "After service, a December 1992 VA examination report reflecting a history of having come under small arms fire in a helicopter during service in Vietnam notes that the Veteran was transferred by helicopter on a weekly basis to psychiatric appointments.\n",
      "Although the June 1969 separation examination report shows psychiatric evaluation was normal, on the accompanying medical history the Veteran indicated that he had depression or excessive worry, memory loss, and nervous trouble.With respect to diagnosis, and although a November 2011 VA examination report reflects a diagnosis of somatoform disorder, a November 2010 VA examination report noting a history of the Veteran's camp having regularly come under mortar attack during service in Vietnam reflects the Veteran meets the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.\n",
      "Consistent with the November 2010 VA examiner's opinion is the opinion of the July 2011 private physician who determined that the Veteran meets the criteria for not only a diagnosis of PTSD but also generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).\n",
      "Both the July 2011 private report and the December 1992 VA examination report conclude that the most traumatic circumstance of the Veteran's Vietnam service was related to the Veteran not being permitted to carry a gun due to his psychiatric disorder.\n",
      "The private report states that the Veteran felt terrified and feared for his life the entire time he was serving in Vietnam.\n",
      "The physician noted that PTSD is most severe in individuals such as the Veteran who have an underlying psychiatric disorder such as GAD.\n",
      "Based on this new July 2011 private treatment report, in conjunction with the other evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran has PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder related to service.Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the evidence is in favor of the claim.\n",

      "The Board finds that a review of the evidence of record, to include competent private and VA medical opinions, service treatment records (STRs), and lay statements, reveals that the Veteran's condition is etiologically related to the injury he sustained during service.\n",
      "As such, the Veteran's claim for service connection must be granted.\n",
      "Generally, to prevail on a claim of service connection on the merits, there must be competent evidence of (1) current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence or other competent evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury.\n",

      "Every veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment; or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.\n",

      "Thus, there is a rebuttable presumption of soundness unless a condition is noted at entry.\n",
      "However, the presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury manifests in service which was not noted on entry, and a question arises as to whether it pre-existed service.\n",

      "VA's General Counsel has held that to rebut the presumption of sound condition under 38 U.S.C.A.\n",
      "\\u00a7 1111, VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence both that the disease or injury existed prior to service and that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service.\n",
      "VAOPGCPREC 3-2003 (July 16, 2003); see also Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed.\n",
      "Cir.\n",
      "2004).The Board notes that the Veteran has continuously contended that his current symptomatic back condition was related or aggravated by an incident during service where his squad was instructed to jump into foxholes during a training exercise and another solider, who jumped into the same foxhole, landed on his back.\n",
      "As an initial matter, the Board finds that the evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran's back condition clearly and unmistakably pre-existed his period of active duty service, and that there is certainly no clear and unmistakable evidence that the any such condition was not aggravated during his service.\n",
      "Preliminarily, the Board notes that the Veteran enlisted in May 1972, entry examinations in his STRs noted no issues or pre-existing problems with his back upon entry.\n",
      "The report of medical history, completed by the Veteran himself also noted no issues with his back.In June 1972, only a few weeks after entering service, the STRs reveal that the Veteran reported to sick-call with lower back pain (denoted as LBP).\n",
      "Further treatment records for that time period noted treatment and testing for his back injury he sustained during training.\n",
      "Later in June 1972, the Veteran's condition was evaluated by the Army Medical Board, where it was determined that the Veteran's back condition rendered him physically unfit for active service, and he was subsequently discharged from service.\n",
      "The Medical Board's decision also noted that the Veteran's condition was believed to have prevented him from physical civilian work prior to service.\n",
      "Related to this claim, the VA afforded the Veteran with two VA Compensation and Pension (C&P) examinations in May 2009 and January 2015.\n",
      "Upon examination of the Veteran and his medical history, both VA examiners initially noted that the Veteran's back condition more likely than not pre-existed his service.\n",
      "However, the Board finds that neither examiner provided an adequate level of affirmation of the Veteran's pre-existing condition to rebut the Veteran's presumption of soundness.\n",
      "In other words, the level of standard to rebut the Veteran's presumption of soundness is clear and unmistakable, a far cry from as least likely as not.\n",
      "Short of that standard of proof and rationale offered by an examiner, such rebuttal under 38 U.S.C.A.\n",
      "\\u00a7 1111, cannot succeed.\n",
      "To this end, the Board notes that the Veteran has submitted several lay statements from his co-worker/classmates and his sports coach during high school, noting that they witnessed and knew of no evidence that the Veteran suffered from any type of back condition.\n",
      "While the Board understands that both such statements come from lay persons without the appropriate medical background and training to diagnose a back condition, the Board finds that such statements remain probative because of the circumstance of their, then, relationship.\n",
      "In other words, the Board finds that as the Veteran's football teammate during high school, and his coach for football and track and field, both lay persons have a unique perspective in evaluating any restrictions of the Veteran's physical abilities.\n",
      "In the same vein, the Board notes that the Veteran graduated from high school in 1971, only a year before enlisting.\n",
      "Such temporal proximity only increases the validity and weight of the probative value of such statements establishing a sound physical condition prior to entering his active service.\n",
      "Finally, the weight of the competent evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran's back condition was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated during service; or the second prong of rebutting the presumption of soundness.\n",
      "In fact, the January 2015 VA examiner has also opined, that the injury in service did in fact aggravate/exacerbated any back condition the Veteran may or may not have had.\n",
      "As such, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not rise to the level as to rebut the presumption of soundness and an evaluation of service connection, on a direct basis must be made.\n",
      "As noted above, the threshold question for service connection must be the existence of a current disability.\n",
      "To this end, the Board finds that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a back condition, specifically spondylolisthesis of the L5-S1 with bilateral pars interarticularis defect.\n",
      "This diagnosis has been confirmed by VA examiners as well as the Veteran's treating physicians and medical professionals.\n",
      "Therefore, the first element of service connection has been satisfied.\n",
      "The second prong of an in-service injury or incurrence is also well documented in the Veteran's STRs.\n",
      "Specifically, notes in the Veteran's STRs indicated the Veteran injured his back and suffered from low back pain during service.\n",
      "The Veteran has also consistently reported that his back was injured when a fellow solider jumped into the same foxhole he was in and landed on his back.\n",
      "Such evidence is ample to satisfy the in-service element for service connection.\n",
      "Finally, the third prong to establish service connection, also known as the nexus element, has also been established by the evidence of record.\n",
      "Here, there are both positive and negative medical opinions, regarding the Veteran's current back condition.\n",
      "Regarding a nexus, the Board notes that the Veteran has submitted a private medical opinion from his treating medical professional, who attests to the fact that the Veteran's current back condition was aggravated/exacerbated, or otherwise caused, by his injury to his back during service.\n",
      "Specifically, the Veteran's long time chiropractor, F. A., found that the Veteran's current symptomatic condition was caused by a trauma, such as that described during his military service, and that such force exacerbated/caused his current back condition.\n",
      "See Medical Opinion from F. A., D. C., dated July 22, 2008.\n",
      "Conversely, the VA has also obtained two medical opinions that are seemingly against the above private opinion regarding nexus.\n",
      "The Veteran was afforded two VA C&P examination for this condition in May 2009 and January 2015.\n",
      "In both examination reports, the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's current condition was simply a continuation of his back condition that pre-existed his active military service.\n",
      "In both instances, the VA examiners specifically cited the Army Medical Board findings of June 1972 that the Veteran was never actually physically fit for active service.\n",
      "Therefore, both VA examiners opined that such back condition could not be solely caused by the Veteran's injury during service.\n",
      "The Veteran was afforded the first of these examinations in May 2009, the examiner, after reviewing the claims file and examining the Veteran's back, concluded that the Veteran's condition pre-existed his military service.\n",
      "However, the Board finds that this examiner's opinion to be inadequate.\n",
      "The VA examiner failed to provide any rationale regarding his conclusion that the Veteran's back condition pre-existed his military service, as he based his nexus conclusion solely on the Army Medical Boards evaluation.\n",
      "That examiner also failed to provide any opinion regarding any aggravating/exacerbating effects the Veteran's in-service injury may have had on his current condition.\n",
      "As such, this opinion is inadequate and carries little probative weight.\n",
      "The Veteran's second VA C&P examination, in January 2015, provides a confusing and nearly contradictory conclusion and rationale.\n",
      "Specifically, the examiner concluded that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's condition was incurred or caused by the claimed in-service injury, explaining that such condition was not caused by an acute injury.\n",
      "However, later in the report, the examiner also noted in another worksheet that the condition was not proximately due to any service-connected disability, and explicitly opined that the Veteran's present back condition \\\"appears to be due to his back injury of June 1972,\\\" during his active duty service, as well as post-service back injuries.\n",
      "The Board finds that two opinions to be at best inadequate and nearly contradictory, offering almost a positive nexus opinion in the latter opinion.\n",
      "As such, the Board finds that this opinion, like the VA examination preceding it, to be inadequate and offers little probative value.\n",
      "Consequently, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise regarding a nexus between the Veteran's current condition and his injury during his military service.\n",
      "Therefore, in affording the Veteran the benefit-of-the-doubt, the Veteran's claim of service connection for a back condition must be granted.\n",
      "Service Connection - Acquired Psychiatric Condition, PTSD The Veteran claims, essentially, that his PTSD, or any acquired psychiatric condition, to include major depressive disorder, is due to his back condition, which has been service connected herein.\n",
      "The Board has construed the claim in accordance with Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet.\n",
      "App.\n",
      "1 (2009) (observing that when determining the scope of a claim, the Board must consider the claimant's description of the claim; the symptoms the claimant describes; and the information the claimant submits or that the Secretary obtains in support of that claim).\n",

      "He maintains that his variously diagnosed psychiatric disorder stems from the trauma of potentially being deployed to a combat zone in Vietnam while stationed in Japan during service in 1974.\n",
      "Initially, the Board notes that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.\n",
      "Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet.\n",
      "App.\n",
      "1 (2009).\n",
      "The Veteran specifically identified PTSD as the claimed disability in his December 2010 claim.\n",
      "However, as noted in the Board's October 2014 remand, other potential psychiatric disorders reflected in the record result in a claim with a broader scope than solely PTSD.The Veteran's DD FORM 214 reflects his military occupational specialty (MOS) is listed as \\\"DSTE\\\" (Digital Subscriber Terminal Equipment) maintenance repairman.\n",
      "Although there is no indicia of service in Vietnam, five months and 19 days of foreign service is noted, and service treatment records document service in Japan.\n",
      "Further, the June 1970 service entrance examination report shows that psychiatric evaluation was normal, and on the accompanying medical history, he denied having or having had depression or excessive worry and nervous trouble of any sort.\n",
      "A January 1973 service treatment records reflects a diagnosis of chest wall syndrome secondary to anxiety.\n",
      "In addition, the August 1974 separation examination report, which was accomplished at Yokota Air Base in Japan, reflects two episodes of chest pain diagnosed as chest wall syndrome secondary to anxiety, one of which was noted to have occurred in 1974.\n",
      "Additionally, and although a December 2010 VA treatment record reflects an impression of PTSD based on the Veteran's detailed, self-report of numerous traumas experienced during alleged service in Vietnam, the July 2012 VA examiner clarified that the Veteran did not serve in Vietnam, noting the Veteran's admission that he never had orders to rebuild a damaged communication center in Vietnam.\n",
      "\\\"Instead, he states that his memories and nightmares are of the time he was stationed in Japan 'just sitting and waiting and anticipating you might get orders.'\n",
      "It was noted that the Veteran recalled that he was fearful that he might be sent to Vietnam.\n",
      "Moreover, both the July 2012 and February 2011 VA examiners specifically determined that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD based upon clinical testing.\n",
      "Although the Veteran's VA psychiatrist noted in April 2016 that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were related to his fear of deployment to high threat zones during service, with a corresponding daily fear of death, culminating in his current symptoms, which were noted to be very similar to those experienced in individuals with PTSD, the diagnosis entered was chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features, not PTSD.\n",
      "The Board notes that although the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms, medical expertise is necessary to provide a diagnosis of any certain psychiatric disorder.\n",
      "See, e.g., Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed.\n",
      "Cir.\n",
      "2014) (\\\"PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence .\n",
      ".\n",
      ".\n",
      "is competent and sufficient to identify.\\\").\n",
      "Here, the probative evidence establishes that the Veteran neither served in Vietnam nor met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD at any time during the appeal period.\n",
      "Thus, the Board finds that service connection for PTSD is not warranted.\n",
      "With respect to diagnoses other than PTSD, and although a December 2011 letter from the Veteran's VA psychiatrist notes depressive disorder, not otherwise specified (NOS), the July 2012 VA examiner determined that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder.\n",
      "In addition, the February 2015 VA examination report reflecting a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder notes that the conflict in the evidence made it difficult to determine whether the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were related to service.\n",
      "The examiner added that although the Veteran may believe that his symptoms are due to his experiences during service in Japan, he likely engages in significant misattribution.\n",
      "On the other hand, in addition to chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features diagnosed by the Veteran's VA psychiatrist in April 2016 and noted to be related to service, the February 2017 VHA addendum opinion states that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's recurrent manifestations of anxiety have been exacerbated by service, at least in part.\n",
      "To the extent that the February 2017 VHA addendum opinion raises the possibility of a psychiatric disability existing prior to service entrance, in the absence of clear and unmistakable evidence showing that a psychiatric disorder existed prior to service entrance and was not aggravated by such service, the presumption of soundness at service entrance is not rebutted.\n",

      "In short, the Veteran's claimed stressor of being attacked and hit in the head over and over is not credible.\n",
      "Far from being verified, this stressor has, in fact, been contradicted by the objective evidence of record.\n",
      "In addition, there is no current diagnosis of PTSD of record.\n",
      "In September 2006, May 2009, July 2011, screens for PTSD were negative; screen for PTSD in June 2013 was positive.\n",
      "In addition, two PTSD screens administered on the same day in May 2009, resulted in one administered by a psychiatrist being negative and one administered by a nurse being positive.\n",
      "A September 2009, Axis I diagnosis included \\\"r/o PTSD.\\\"  Although some treatment records reference a diagnosis of PTSD, none of the PTSD diagnoses are made in conformance with the DSM-IV or V criteria, and as noted above, the single Axis I diagnosis including PTSD is recorded as \\\"r[ule] o[ut] PTSD.\\\"  Subsequent Axis I diagnoses included mood disorder due to medical condition and major depressive disorder in addition to alcohol abuse, cannabis abuse, and tobacco use disorder.\n",
      "Thus, the Board finds that the reference to \\\"r/o PTSD\\\" and the noted \\\"cva with PTSD\\\" in the VA treatment records cannot be interpreted as a finding that PTSD is a current disability, or that it has been present at any specific time pertinent to the appeal.\n",
      "In summary, the Board finds that the most competent, credible, and probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran currently or at any point during the appeal period has received a valid diagnosis of PTSD.\n",
      "The Board further finds that the Veteran's claimed stressor of being hit in the head over and over is not credible and neither stressor has been verified.\n",
      "The weight of the competent evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD, and there is no independent evidence corroborating the Veteran's statement as to the occurrence of his claimed stressors.\n",
      "As such, the evidence of record does not establish a DSM-V diagnosis of PTSD based upon a verified stressor event.\n",
      "Thus, for the foregoing reasons, the claim for service connection for PTSD must be denied.\n",
      "In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable.Pes PlanusOn his Report of Medical Examination in September 1975 for the purpose of enlistment, the Veteran's feet were noted to be abnormal and he was diagnosed as having \\\"pes planus 2\\u00a7, asymptomatic.\\\"  On the Report of Medical History completed by the Veteran in conjunction with his entrance physical, he denied ever having foot trouble.\n",

      "He is the recipient of numerous awards and decorations, to include the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Purple Heart with an Oak Leaf Cluster.This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2011 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, Kentucky, which denied service connection for PTSD.The record reflects that the Veteran has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder in addition to PTSD.\n",
      "The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental health disability that could reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.\n",

      "The Veteran was also experiencing chronic pain from several serious workplace injuries and surgery that forced him to retire and created financial distress.\n",
      "The psychiatrist diagnosed only a depressive episode without further explanation.\n",
      "The Veteran began periodic VA outpatient mental health treatment.\n",
      "In November 2010, the attending psychologist continued to diagnose a depressive disorder, mentioning the Veteran's struggle with VA for benefits and general references to past military experiences.\n",
      "The RO received the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD in November 2010, and the Veteran underwent a VA mental health examination in January 2011.\n",
      "The VA psychologist did not review the claims file, but found the Veteran to be a reliable historian and noted detailed summaries of the Veteran's combat experiences, post-combat performance problems and discipline, the death of his first wife in 1999, remarriage in 2001 with a supportive relationship, and physical disabilities that caused his retirement in March 2009.\n",
      "On examination, the psychologist noted the Veteran's report of a \\\"fair\\\" mood and difficulty sleeping because of physical pain, but no other deficits.\n",
      "The psychologist acknowledged that the Veteran's combat experiences would be sufficient to meet the event criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, but that no diagnosis of a mental health disorder was appropriate because the symptoms were limited to expected reactions to stressors such as the death of his first wife and unwanted forced retirement due to medical issues and related financial distress, and not to the events in military service.\n",
      "The Veteran stopped VA outpatient mental health treatment in February 2011 but returned to seek primary care in April 2012.\n",
      "A primary care physician noted the Veteran's reports of irritable mood, flashbacks, and nightmares about his experiences in Vietnam triggered while driving and smelling smoke.\n",
      "The physician referred the Veteran for further mental health care.\n",
      "In May 2012, a licensed social worker noted the Veteran's reports of his current family situation and inability to work because of his multiple physical disabilities.\n",
      "The Veteran reported symptoms of irritability, depression, and interrupted sleep as well as occasional panic attacks, but there was no mention by the Veteran or the examiner of any events in service.\n",
      "The social worker diagnosed depression associated with adjustment to mobility deficits.\n",
      "In a follow-up examination the same day, a VA psychiatrist noted that the Veteran's mood was \\\"down but not overly so\\\" and that symptoms of PTSD were greatly reduced.\n",
      "In subsequent treatment encounters in July 2012 and August 2012, the attending psychiatrist diagnosed both major depressive disorder and related PTSD with diminishing symptoms that did not interfere with activities.\n",
      "However, in August 2012, the psychiatrist noted that the Veteran was not depressed on that occasion.\n",
      "In October 2012, the VA social worker noted some improvement in isolative behaviors, anger issues, and disturbed sleep with the use of medication, but that the Veteran continued to display a depressed mood caused by thoughts of his fellow soldiers killed in Vietnam, how he was treated during service, his physical disabilities, and the death of his first wife.\n",
      "In November 2012, the Veteran was diagnosed with major depressive disorder.\n",
      "VA treatment records dated from February 2013 through May 2013 show diagnoses of major depressive disorder and PTSD, and ongoing treatment for such disorders from the Veteran's treating psychiatrist, psychologist, and social worker.During the September 2013 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he was currently under treatment in an intensive program at a VA mental health clinic for PTSD, major depression, and anxiety disorder since April 10, 2013, and that his psychiatrist had associated the disorders with his combat service.\n",
      "The Board finds that service connection for PTSD and major depressive disorder is warranted.\n",
      "As an initial matter, the Board finds that the Veteran's reports of his traumatic events during combat in Vietnam and current symptoms are competent because they are observable by lay persons and have been accepted without challenge by all clinicians and the January 2011 examiner and are consistent with his service records.\n",
      "Moreover, as the Veteran served in combat, his lay statements are sufficient to verify his in-service stressors.The Board acknowledges that there is competent evidence both for and against a finding that the Veteran has a current psychiatric disorder related to his in-service combat stressors.\n",
      "The VA psychologist in January 2011 provided a detailed history and comprehensive report of his examination in which he acknowledged the combat events and found that they met the traumatic event criteria.\n",
      "However, he found that the Veteran did not have any diagnosed psychiatric disorder on that one occasion, but did not have access to or mention the nature of the VA outpatient care that was provided prior to his examination.\n",
      "On the other hand, outpatient clinicians in 2010 diagnosed depression and possible PTSD, albeit with little detailed rationale.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the clinicians acknowledged the combat events as well as the death of the Veteran's first wife, his workplace injuries and surgery, and his involuntary retirement.\n",
      "In 2012, the outpatient clinicians affirmatively diagnosed mild symptoms of depression and PTSD without conditional language, but again with little detailed analysis or rationale, referring to both physical disabilities as a cause for depression and combat events as causes for nightmares, intrusive memories, and irritability.\n",
      "However, beginning in February 2013, VA treatment records reflect diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder, and ongoing treatment for such disorders from the Veteran's treating psychiatrist, psychologist, and social worker.\n",
      "Moreover, the Veteran's testimony regarding a 2013 intensive mental health treatment program for PTSD, depression, and anxiety, which he reported had been related to his in-service combat stressors, is competent and credible in light of his ongoing treatment for such disorders.\n",
      "Therefore, resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence shows that diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder were rendered during portions of the pendency of the Veteran's claim and such were, at least in part, related to traumatic events during combat in Vietnam.\n",
      "Consequently, service connection for such acquired psychiatric disorders is warranted.\n",

      "For example, in a June 1977 service personnel record a counselor opined that:I have personally interviewed this SM and found him to have a good attitude towards the Army.\n",

      "His ability to read and comprehend the material in his AIT course is extremely poor, and his exam grades indicated that he will develop[] into a marginal soldier at best.\n",

      "The clinician opined that \\\"It is LESS LIKELY THAN NOT that the Veteran's claimed mental health condition, to include PTSD, incurred, was caused by or proximately due to his 6 months in military service.\\\"  In support of her opinion, the clinician relied on the absence of verification of the Veteran's stressors; the in-service counseling report showing discharge due to an academic deficiency; and the absence of \\\"medically based scientific evidence found in his service record to indicate that his short time in military service...[was] the underlying cause of his current diagnoses of PTSD and Depression.\\\"  The clinician also opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's mental health condition is caused by, proximately due to, or related to his service-connected bilateral lower extremity disabilities, to include peripheral neuropathy and vascular disease, because \\\"[t]here is no current literature or scientifically based medical evidence to support such a nexus.\\\"The Board finds that the clinician's opinion is competent because she is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions.\n",

      "Again, the Veteran has not submitted any medical evidence to the contrary.\n",
      "While current VA and private treatment records reflect treatment for a number of respiratory complaints, none of the Veteran's treatment provider has opined that these conditions are related to the Veteran's service.\n",

      "Thus, to establish service connection, there must be probative evidence linking his currently diagnosed psychiatric disorders with any instance of his military service.\n",
      "Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim.In this regard, in March 2015 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with his claim for service connection.\n",
      "Following an interview with the Veteran, a review of the record, and a mental status examination, the examiner diagnosed an unspecified depressive disorder and substance abuse disorders, in sustained remission.\n",

      "Nevertheless, the examiner opined that the Veteran's depressive disorder was not related to his service and that his depressive symptoms are related to a \\\"long history of personality features and/or his substance abuse history.\\\"   The Board finds that the opinion of the VA examiner provided after reviewing the claims file and examining the Veteran is highly probative as it reflects consideration of all relevant facts and the examiner provided a detailed rationale for the conclusion reached.\n",

      "Accordingly, his opinion as to the diagnosis or etiology of the current psychiatric symptomology is not competent medical evidence.\n",
      "The Board finds the opinion of the VA examiner to be significantly more probative than his lay assertions.Moreover, the Board recognizes that the Veteran reported at his March 2015 examination and elsewhere that he began abusing drugs during service and that the examiner attributed his current depressive symptoms to the Veteran's drug abuse history.\n",

      "More recent treatment records show that the Veteran's son is nonverbal and has quadriparesis/spastic quadriplegia and seizures, requiring constant care.The Board has carefully reviewed the medical records outlined above, but finds that the weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran's current psychiatric diagnoses had their onset during or are related to her military service.\n",
      "The evidence of record does establish that the Veteran has a current psychiatric disability, which has been variously diagnosed as PTSD, MDD, anxiety disorder, and adjustment disorder.\n",

      "This event led to a resurgence of memories associated with the rape, including the name of one of her attackers, T., as well as a woman who later helped protect her from the rapists, E.  The social worker who authored the note indicated that memories of her rape appeared to have been the core of the Veteran's current dysphoria.\n",
      "This treatment note raises additional inconsistencies in the information provided by the Veteran.\n",
      "Although the Veteran told the provider she remembered names of two servicemembers involved in the incident, the Veteran has never provided any name of a fellow former servicemember for purposes of development of her claim for compensation.\n",
      "Her statements at the April 2003 VA treatment visit are inconsistent with her actions since that time.\n",
      "That inconsistency undermines her credibility.The Board has considered all the evidence of record regarding an alleged sexual assault that the Veteran reports occurred during her active service.\n",
      "The fact that no service department records of the incident have been located does not weigh against the possible occurrence or the Veteran's credibility, since VA regulations recognize that such incidents, if reported, were not uniformly documented.\n",
      "However, in the October 2003 stressor statement, the Veteran stated that she could not remember the names of any individuals involved.\n",

      "Review of the service personnel records shows no indication of disciplinary actions, adverse personnel actions, drop in performance, or requests for reassignment.\n",
      "During active service she states that she was awarded the outstanding recruit award, her August 1969 performance evaluation was excellent.\n",
      "The Veteran reported, at the November 2002 VA examination, that she enjoyed both active service and reserve service.\n",
      "The Veteran reported that she chose to be discharged from active service in August 1969 due in part to the sexual abuse, but her performance obviously did not deteriorate in any way due to the alleged assault.\n",
      "Importantly, in August 1969, just three months after the alleged sexual assault occurred in May 1969, the Veteran received an excellent performance review.The Veteran enlisted in 1983 for six additional years of reserve service and was promoted.\n",
      "Her reserve component service performance record was also excellent and unblemished.\n",
      "It reflects only high achievement and excellent work ethic.\n",
      "Significantly, VA outpatient treatment records from 2000 and 2001 do not contain any allegation of any kind of military sexual trauma or abuse.\n",
      "The first evidence of a report of military sexual trauma is from August 2002, after the Veteran filed her claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.\n",
      "Notably, prior to August 2002, the Veteran specifically alleged other stressors, to include the helicopter crash, seeing dead bodies, and generalized nightmares about people she knew who may have died serving in Vietnam.\n",
      "This is not necessarily significant in and of itself, yet, combined with the other credibility evidence of record; the Board finds that it diminishes her credibility somewhat in that her descriptions regarding her stressors have changed at various examinations.The Veteran was referred to the VA Mental Health Clinic in September 2002 following a positive military sexual trauma and PTSD screening.\n",
      "It was at that time she was diagnosed with PTSD due to the military sexual trauma.\n",
      "In contrast, the VA psychiatrist who conducted November 2002 VA examination, two months later, concluded that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.\n",
      "The Board also points out that the examiner had access to and reviewed the Veteran's claims file, to include her prior psychiatric diagnoses, hallucinations, and alleged stressors.\n",
      "As noted above, the November 2012 VA examination report is lengthy, accurate, and provides the reasoning for the examiner's conclusions.\n",
      "In contrast, the VA psychologist who provided the September 2002 diagnosis did not reference review of any records, but, rather, assigned a diagnosis based upon the Veteran's account of her own history.Also probative regarding the Veteran's credibility is the fact that she has told different examiners different facts regarding her history.\n",
      "At the November 2002 VA exam, she stated that in 1987 approximately she started feeling depressed.\n",
      "At the September 2002 PTSD examination, she stated that she has been having mental health issues ever since service.\n",
      "The various psychiatrists and psychologists who have noted PTSD as due to military sexual trauma appear to have done so based only on the Veteran's self-reported history, rather than review of the complete record.\n",

      "However, service personnel records, and later reserve service records in particular, weigh heavily against the Veteran's September 2002 account that she has had mental health problems ever since her active service.\n",
      "As mentioned previously, the stellar performance evaluation reports during her reserve service generally negate the contention that mental health problems, such as psychosis, were present at that time.\n",
      "In addition, the Veteran has claimed that her PTSD is a result of a stressor involving her witnessing and picking up human remains of Marines who had been killed in a helicopter crash in Camp Pendleton.\n",
      "This stressor is a major event, yet remains unverified after all attempts.\n",
      "While the case was on remand status following the 2009 Remand from the Board, the RO was instructed to accomplish all development action in order to corroborate the stressor.\n",
      "The RO acquired a Command Chronology from the Commanding General, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California from July 1968 through December 1968; no helicopter crash was reported.\n",
      "The Veteran then provided statements indicating that, during her reserve service, in 1990, she performed post-crash duties at the site of a helicopter crash in which two female Marines were \\\"torn to pieces.\\\"  No objective confirmation of this stressor has been located.\n",
      "It is not credible that a helicopter crash in 1990 which resulted in fatalities would not have been documented by the service department or the base at which it is alleged to have occurred, or that no other information, such as a newspaper article, reports of aviation accidents, or the like, would be located.\n",
      "The Board finds it very probative that the Veteran has described vividly remembering witnessing a crash involving either 2 (October 2004 VA outpatient records), 8 (November 2002 VA examination), or 13 (October 2000 VA Mental Health Clinic outpatient records, Addendum) dead Marines, to include her roommates, yet there is no objective confirmation of the event.\n",
      "In particular, the Board notes the Veteran's statements that \\\"the media\\\" reported on this crash, but their reports were inaccurate.\n",
      "If the alleged incident had been reported in \\\"the media,\\\" as the Veteran has described, it would be expected that objective information about the incident could be located on the Internet, if not from the service department.\n",

      "The absence of any objective corroboration of the alleged helicopter crash with fatalities is highly unfavorable to the Veteran's contention that she picked up human remains following such an accident.\n",
      "The Veteran is a sympathetic claimant.\n",
      "The record establishes that the Veteran performed her active service honorably and well, and was highly regarded during her reserve component service.\n",
      "The pursuit of this claim for the 15 years of the pendency of this appeal establishes that the Veteran sincerely believes that a current psychiatric disorder is linked to her service.Nevertheless, the preponderance of the evidence is unfavorable to the claim.\n",
      "The available service personnel records, although incomplete, show no indictors of a stressor, such as disciplinary problems or behavioral changes.\n",
      "The lay and medical records are inconsistent with the Veteran's assertion that she had chronic mental health disability symptoms following her active or reserve service.\n",
      "The AMC issued a March 2011 memorandum summary of actions taken in attempt to corroborate the Veteran's alleged PTSD stressors.\n",
      "It was concluded that exhaustive attempts failed to corroborate a stressor and no further development should be conducted.\n",
      "Although the Veteran suggests that it is possible that this crash may have occurred shortly after the Veteran was called up on reserve duty after Desert Storm began in 1991, there simply is no record of 2, 8, or 13 Marines perishing in a helicopter accident at Camp Pendleton at that time either.\n",
      "See http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Chronologies/Yearly/1991.htm and http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Chronologies/Yearly/1992.htm.With regard to psychiatric disorders other than PTSD, the Veteran is diagnosed with depressive disorder with psychotic features and has been receiving SSA disability benefits for severe major depression since August 12, 2001.\n",

      "Petersburg, Florida.The Board notes that in November 2012, the Veteran initially requested a hearing.\n",
      "At the time, the Veteran's representative, the Florida Department of Veteran Affairs (FDVA) requested that if the Veteran did not receive a hearing, the claims file should be returned to the FDVA so it might prepare an informal hearing presentation.\n",

      "In March 2016, Mr.\n",

      "The Veteran explained his PTSD worsened in 2000, when he switched from working night shift to day shift, and he was forced to frequently interact with co-workers and family members.\n",
      "The stress of such interactions increased his temper, and he became verbally abusive toward his family members.\n",
      "Shortly thereafter, he entered treatment at the VA and enrolled in private mental health services where he was diagnosed with depressive disorder and PTSD.The Veteran informed the examiner he dreamed often, but only occasionally about Vietnam.\n",
      "Following his discharge, he often awoke from sleep screaming and in a panicked state, and he still experienced daily, recurrent thoughts of Vietnam.\n",
      "Moreover, he was forced to actively avoid veteran associations or discussions of combat.\n",
      "He tended to avoid crowds or groups of people because of feelings of potential danger or threat and heightened anxiety.\n",
      "He avoided others out of a fear of losing control and angry impulses.\n",
      "Lastly, he experienced trouble controlling his temper and struggled to interact with others at work and with his family.\n",
      "Socially, the Veteran maintained one or two friendships.The examiner determined the Veteran was alert and oriented to all spheres.\n",
      "His appearance was clean, and he was adequately dressed and groomed.\n",
      "His speech was coherent and of a normal rate, rhythm, and tone.\n",
      "He displayed good eye contact and demonstrated appropriate interpersonal interaction.\n",
      "His thought process was logical and goal directed, and he exhibited no overt or reported signs of psychosis, delusion, or hallucination.The examiner concluded that the Veteran suffered from both PTSD and a depressive disorder.\n",
      "The Veteran's experiences in Vietnam served as his traumatic stressor.\n",
      "The examiner believed the Veteran's PTSD developed following his discharge from the service.Following the examination, the Veteran was consistently and continuously diagnosed with PTSD, continued to report symptoms of PTSD, and continuously received both in-patient and out-patient PTSD counseling from 2002 until 2009.In December 2007, the Veteran submitted a statement, concluding that his PTSD caused him to mentally break down at VA hospitals, receive disciplinary charges at work, and forced him to undergo hospitalization for psychiatric care in January 2005.In December 2009, the Veteran underwent a C&P examination for PTSD.\n",
      "However, the Veteran did not complete the exam due to his mental angst.\n",
      "Prior to the examination, the Veteran had asked for and received from his treating psychologist a note stipulating that his wife should be allowed to attend the C&P examination with him.\n",
      "Upon arriving for the C&P examination, the examiner informed him his wife was not allowed to attend.\n",
      "This upset the Veteran to such a degree the examiner was forced to end the examination.In December 2009, the Veteran's daughter submitted a statement in which she concluded her father's PTSD had worsened over the past few months, and she was very worried about his anger.\n",
      "She stated that she never knew what was going to happen around him, and although he continued to receive treatment at the VA, his condition had worsened, not improved.In March 2012, the Veteran received another C&P examination for PTSD, in which the examiner determined the Veteran did not suffer from PTSD.\n",
      "She concluded that the Veteran did not meet PTSD criteria under the DSM-IV Criteria B (re-experiencing), Criteria C (avoidance and numbing), or Criteria D (hyperarousal).\n",
      "The examiner indicated that under Criteria B (re-experiencing), the Veteran did not suffer from recurrent distressing thoughts of the event, or recurrent distressing dreams of the event.\n",
      "Under Criteria C (avoidance and numbing), the Veteran did not actively avoid activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma.\n",
      "Under Criteria D (hyperarousal), the examiner indicated the Veteran did not suffer from irritability or outbursts of anger.\n",
      "Moreover, the examiner could not explain why the Veteran had been diagnosed with PTSD by past treatment providers because she could not review how those providers arrived at a diagnosis.\n",
      "Lastly, she opined that the Veteran merely suffered from isolated symptoms of PTSD which were not sufficient to make a PTSD diagnosis under the DSM-IV.\n",
      "In June 2012, the Veteran submitted a statement explaining that he had received continuous PTSD diagnoses for the past 10 to 12 years, and he continued to suffer from the disease.The Board begins by noting that due to the Veteran's combat service in Vietnam, the RO conceded the existence of in-service stressors.\n",
      "Thus, a discussion concerning stressors is unnecessary.The Board finds that the evidence supports the Veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD.\n",
      "First, the record demonstrates the Veteran served in Vietnam, and the RO conceded that the Veteran's in-service stressors occurred.\n",
      "Second, the Veteran's VA treating physicians believe the Veteran suffers from PTSD.\n",
      "For more than the past decade, the Veteran has complained of and sought treatment for PTSD, and the providers whom the Veteran saw on a daily basis concluded the Veteran suffered from PTSD.\n",
      "Last, the October 2002 C&P examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and concluded that the Veteran's PTSD stemmed from his service in the military.In March 2012, the Veteran underwent a C&P examination for PTSD, in which the examiner concluded the Veteran did not suffer from PTSD.\n",
      "In making this finding, the examiner determined the Veteran did not suffer from the following: recurrent distressing thoughts of the event; recurrent distressing dreams of the event; an avoidance of activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma; or irritability or outbursts of anger.\n",
      "The record, however, directly contradicts those findings.\n",
      "In the October 2002 statement, the Veteran informed the examiner he experienced daily, recurrent thoughts of Vietnam, occasional nightmares, and that he actively avoided veterans and activities associated with Vietnam.\n",
      "Moreover, the Veteran explained to the examiner that he frequently suffered from irritability and anger outbursts with his family and co-workers, and the Veteran continued to assert that in his lay statements.\n",
      "In December 2009, the Veteran's daughter submitted a letter to the RO in which she stated she was worried about her father's worsening anger, unpredictability, and irritability.\n",
      "Due to the fact that the March 2012 examiner mischaracterized the Veteran's symptoms and behavior, the Board finds the examination and examiner's conclusion less than probative.\n",

      "His medical records show that he has been treated for psychiatric symptoms since 1984, and has been hospitalized on several occasions as a result of suicide attempts.\n",
      "He asserts that his continuing symptoms are related to the death of his brother during service.\n",
      "The Board finds that service connection is warranted for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as PTSD, MDD, dysthymia and depression NOS.\n",
      "Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.\n",

      "As an initial matter, the Board notes that the presumption of soundness applies in this matter.\n",
      "A veteran will be considered to have been in sound condition when examined and accepted for service, except as to disorders noted on entrance into service, or when clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the disability existed prior to service and was not aggravated by service.\n",

      "Although there is evidence of record that the Veteran experienced some psychiatric symptoms prior to service, his May 1974 entrance examination revealed no psychiatric disorder.\n",
      "Additionally, even though an October 2010 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD and depression had their onset prior to service, the January 2013 VA examiner opined that it was not undebatable that the Veteran's PTSD and depression pre-existed service.\n",
      "Thus, the Board finds that presumption of soundness applies in this matter and has not been rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence.\n",
      "The issue in this case is whether the Veteran's PTSD and/or depression had an onset in service or is due to an event occurring in service.\n",
      "The Board finds that service connection for PTSD is warranted because the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD linked to the death of his brother during service.\n",
      "There is no dispute that the Veteran's brother died in October 1974, while the Veteran was serving on active duty.\n",

      "See September 2012, February 2013 and April 2014 Private Medical Opinions of J. Smith, Ph.D.\n",
      "The Veteran's VA medical records also show a diagnosis of PTSD during the appeal period.\n",

      "See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet.\n",
      "App.\n",
      "128, 140 (1997).\n",
      "The Board notes that the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners both opined that the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under either the DSM IV or the DSM 5 because his stressor fails to meet Criterion A necessary for PTSD diagnosis.\n",
      "The November 2013 VA examiner also opined that the Veteran denied current significant re-experiencing (Criterion B) symptoms and further denied significant avoidance and impairment in functioning symptoms regarding his reported stressor.\n",
      "However, in his April 2014 addendum opinion, Dr.\n",
      "Smith addressed these criteria, stating that the death of the Veteran's brother did meet Criterion A because the Veteran was confronted with the death of his brother and his response to this news was one of horror and helplessness.\n",
      "Dr.\n",
      "Smith further noted that the diagnosis of PTSD reflects continuing symptoms of poor sleep, marked and continuing anxiety and depression, continued intrusion of \\\"triggering\\\" experiences and events such as contact with his family or hearing reports on the news of young people dying in a hit and run situation, and avoidance of the area of where his brother died.\n",
      "The October 2010 VA examiner also noted that the Veteran reported experiencing intrusive thoughts related to his brother on a weekly basis, and avoidance of therapy because the he \\\"doesn't like to bring up the past.\\\"  Thus, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise on the issue of whether the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD relating to his brother's death.\n",

      "See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet.\n",
      "App.\n",
      "465 (1994).\n",
      "The Board observes that there is evidence of record that contradicts the Veteran's assertion that his symptoms started in service and have been recurrent since that time.\n",
      "Most notably, he was examined multiple times in service and found to have no psychiatric disorder.\n",
      "See February 1975 Report of Mental Status Evaluation; see also May 1975 Mental Hygiene Consultation Report.\n",
      "However, the Veteran reported that his psychiatric examination was very brief.\n",
      "Additionally, Dr.\n",
      "Smith opined that the examination \\\"appeared to be simply designed to meet an administrative requirement and did not constitute a full psychiatric examination\\\" because the examination report showed no evidence that the examiner explored the Veteran's reaction to his brother's death.\n",
      "See April 2014 Addendum Private Medical Opinion of J. Smith.\n",
      "Thus, the Board does not find the lack of a psychiatric diagnosis on examination during service to be determinative.\n",
      "After weighing the evidence and affording the Veteran the benefit of all reasonable doubt, the Board finds his reports regarding the onset and continuation of his depressive symptoms to be credible.\n",
      "As noted by the March 2016, the Veteran's reports of ongoing psychiatric symptoms have been consistent.\n",
      "In August 1989, when discussing the history of his depression, he stated that his brother's death had been very traumatic for him.\n",
      "See August 1989 VA Medical Record.\n",
      "At a February 2006 group therapy session, he talked about how his brother's death was \\\"still bothering him.\\\"  See February 2006 VA Medical Record.\n",

      "See April 2006 Psychological Examination Report.\n",
      "The Board notes that he reported having \\\"problems\\\" beginning in 1984, but that during the same time frame he also reported first seeking treatment in 1984 and first experiencing an impact in his ability to work in 1984.\n",
      "Thus, it appears that he did not mean that his symptoms started at that time, but that he became significantly impaired in 1984.\n",

      "The November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners opined that the Veteran's depression was not related to his brother's death because there were no contemporaneous medical records confirming his reports of depressive symptoms prior to 1984.\n",
      "The November 2013 VA examiner also reasoned that there were no mention of mental health issues in the letters the Veteran submitted from friends and family in support of his discharge from service.\n",

      "The evidence of record shows that the purpose of those letters was to corroborate the Veteran's assertion that his change in religious viewed prevented him from serving on active duty; consequently, it is not expected that any discussion of depressive symptoms would be included in such letters.\n",
      "For these reasons, the Board affords the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners' negative nexus opinions little probative value.\n",

      "There is credible supporting evidence of the Veteran's in-service exposure to noncombat-related stressors in the Marine Corps in April 1975 during Operations Eagle Pull and Frequent Wind, involving evacuations in Cambodia and Vietnam.\n",
      "These stressors included rockets and bombs heard on the outskirts of the cities, mass evacuations of embassy and civilian personnel with panic and unsanitary conditions, and witnessing the bodies of 30 dead marines.2.\n",
      "There is an approximate balance of favorable and unfavorable evidence as to whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD that is related to the confirmed in-service stressors from Cambodia and Vietnam.CONCLUSION OF LAWResolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the Veteran has PTSD with depression that was incurred in active military service.\n",
